           should be repeated, whereas a set bit increments the line counter.
           The bits are rotated in a 5, 6, 7 or 8 bit cycle depending on
           3d4h index 75h bit 0-1.

  3d4h index 77h (R/W): LC Adjust
  bit 0-4  Latch Clock Adjust. Number of dots times to add to
           Start and End Blanking times, as plasma and EL
           panels require strict timings.

  3d4h index 78h (R/W): Vertical Screen Size H
    bit 0  Bit 8 of the Vertical Screen Size.
           The lower 8 bits are in 3d4h index 79h.

  3d4h index 79h (R/W): Vertical Screen Size L
  bit 0-7  Vertical Screen Size bit 0-7. Bit 8 is in 3d4h index 78h.
           For full screen panels this value is the number of lines
           on the display-1 typically 479.
           For Dual Panel Single Drive types use (number of lines in
           each panel-1)*2 typically 478.
           For Dual Panel Dual Drive types use (number of lines in
           each panel-1) typically 239.

  3d4h index 7Ah (R/W): Horizontal Screen Size
  bit 0-7  Horizontal Screen Size. For Dual Panel Dual Drive types
           this is (number of dots per line)/4 -1 typically 159.
           For other types this is (number of dots per line)/8 -1
           typically 79.

  3d4h index 7Bh (R/W): M Signal Pulse Width H
  bit 0-1  Bits 8-9 of the M Signal C ontrol.

           Bits 8-9 are in 3d4h index 7Bh bits 0-1.
           This sets the cycle time for reversing the polarity of
           the AC conversion signal M which is transmitted to the
           LCD panel.
           This is a way of controlling the brightness of the display.

             2  2 Screen Dual Drive type.
      2-3  Selects number of bits to transfer for each pixel.
             0 = 1 bit serial, 1 = 4 bit parallel and 2 = 8 bit parallel.
        4  If set the Shift Clock is output constantly, otherwise
           only during display intervals.
        6  If set FLM is output 2 cycles delayed from VSYNC,
           if clear they are simultaneous.
        7  If set the cursor blinks at a field cycle of 32, 16 if not.

  3d4h index 7Eh (R/W): Stand By
    bit 0  If set VPDC functions are stopped and Stand-by mode is
           entered. Operation is resumed when this bit is cleared.
           If DRAMs are used for Video RAM the content of display
           memory will be lost in Stand-by mode.
        1  If set writing of the Configuration Switches Register
           (3d4h index 7Fh) from the CPU is enabled.

  3d4h index 7Fh (R/W): Configuration Switches
  bit 0-3  Display Type
      4-5  Panel/CRT connection
            0  VGA CRT (analog) connected

            2 or 3  Flat panel connected
        6  SRAM is used if set, DRAM else
        7  Scratch

  3d4h index 80h..FFh (R/W): Color Map Registers.
  bit 0-3  Color Map for color #((index#-80h)*2)
      4-7  Color Map for color #((index#-80h)*2+1)

  Grey Scale/Hatching

    The Yamaha 6388 VPDC can support both analog, digital and
    various panel, plasma and LCD displays.
    In order to display original color information on displays
    with limited colors (monochrome, 8, 16 or 64 colors/shades)
    some conversions must be made.
    The VPDC has a Color Mapping Table (CMT) which converts
    the 8bit color signal to 4 bits.
    This 4 bit code is either used directly for output
    or sent through a Grey Scale/Hatching (G/H) converter.
