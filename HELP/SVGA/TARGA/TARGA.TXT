Targa
Targa+

Usually the Targa+ operates in Non-Contigous mode where the 16 I/O registers
used are spread in 4 groups of 4 registers each separated by 400h. By setting
a jumper the Targa+ can operate in Contigous mode where the 16 registers are
laid out sequentially. Also the base I/O address is set by jumpers.

Note that this is one adapter where the indexed registers can really be 16bit
wide, so that the notation W(R/W) indicates ONE 16bit index, not two 8bit ones

          This is functionally equivalent to the VGA register 3C6h

ADV index DBh (R/W):  LUT READ
bit  0-7  This is the read index into the RAMDAC palette. First write the
          index of the palette color to this register, then read three times
          from the LUT COLOR PALETTE register (index D9h) (red, green and then
          blue). When the blue data is read, this register is automatically
          incremented.

ADV index E7h (R/W):  SVIDEO
bit  0-6  Should be set to 1
       7  SVHS. If VIDCON (ADV index E4h) bit 6 is clear this bit selects
          whether the input is a standard composite signal (0) or Svideo (1).
          Svideo means you have separate Y and C signals.

ADV index E8h (R/W):  VIDEOMODE
bit  0-1  BufferPortSrc. Only valid if index E9h bit 0 is 0.
          Determines the input to the Buffer Port Input of the Blender
           0: 8bits, 1: lower 16bits, 2: upper 16bits, 3: 24bits
     2-3  Which8. Selects the byte (Red, Green, Blue or Alpha) sent to the
          Blender Input 2 (in 8bit mode) or used as overlay control data (in
          32bit mode). 0: Blue, 1: Green, 2: Red, 3: Alpha
       4  MonoSrc. If bits 5-6 are 0 this selects the source of the monochrome
          capture. 0: green input channel, 1: Chromakeyer
     5-6  CM. TARGA+ capture mode:  0: Mono, 2: 16bit color, 3: 24bit color
       7  bbyp.  If set the Blender is bypassed and the output to the DACs is
          directly from the VRAM

ADV index E9h (R/W):  BUFFERPORT
bit    0  BufferPortColor.  If set the Buffer Port Input of the Blender is fed
          from the Border Color registers, if clear from VRAM
       1  LivePortColor. If set (and BLENDER1 bit 4 is set) the Live Port of
          the Blender receives bits 0-14 of the border color registers, rather
          than from VRAM
       2  LiveMixColor. If set, Color3 provides the LIVEMIX control signal
     3-4  LutByp. Contro9ls whether the output of the Blender is passed
          through or around the LUTs
       5  Alpha8. Data width of the Alpha channel. 8bit if set, 7 if clear.
     6-7  LiveMixGain. Shiftvalue for the alpha control values passed to the

ADV index EAh (R/W):  MIXCTRL3
bit  0-1  overlaySrc. Specifies the source of the overlay control signal.
          If index D0h bit 2 is set, the source is:
            0: 8bit masked compare, 2: 15/24 bit compare
          if clear, the source is:
            0: bit 15 of VRAM, 1: bit 31 of VRAM, 2: 0
       2  overlayInv. If set the overlay control data is inverted before being
          used.
       3  liveMixInv. If set the Alpha control signal is inverted before
          reaching the blender.
       4  CM3. If set the Targa+ recaptures the blended output from the
          blenders.
     5-7  Reserved. Should be set to 0

ADV index EBh (R/W):  LIVEPORT
bit  0-2  Reserved. Should be set to 0
       3  livePortWord. Only valid if bit 4 set and index E9h bit 1 is clear.
          If set the upper 16 bits of VRAM are sent to the blender, if clear
          the lower 16 bits are used
       4  livePortSrc. If set the blender is fed from the border color
          registers or from VRAM, if clear live data is fed to the blender.
       5  live8. Only active if bit 4 is set and 
       6  fgp. Controls the ForeGround processor used in conjugation with the
          chromakeyer.
       7  Reserved. Should be set to 0

ADV index ECh (R/W):  INVERT
bit    0  ZeroBlue. If set the blue signal does not participate in the
          calculation of chroma signal
       1  Chroma. If set the chromaOut signal only depends on the blue input
     2-5  Should be set to 9
       6  GreenKey. If set the red signal input does not participate in the
          calculation of the chroma signal, if clear the green input is left
          out.
       7  livePortInv. If set the live data being routed to Blender Input 1
          will be inverted
Note: The chroma output is:
      ChromaOut = [(blur - max(red,green))* (1-zeroBlue)] +
               [(255-(green*GreenKey)+(red*(1-Greenkey)))]*(1-chroma)

          signal is 0

ADV index EEh (R/W):  OVLLEVEL
bit  0-7  This value is used as a constant blend value when the B-level blend
          mode is selected (bit 0 of VIDCON (ADV index E4h) is 0) and the OVL
          signal is 1
