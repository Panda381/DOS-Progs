        3  LINETYPE.
             0: Bresenham line drawing
                  CMD_LINE draws a line using the Bresenham algorithm as
                  specified in the DESTY_AXSTP (8AE8h), DESTX_DIASTP (8EE8h),
                  ERR_TERM (92E8h) and MAJ_AXIS_PCNT (96E8h) registers
             1: Vector line draws.
                  CMD_NOP allows drawing of Short Stroke Vectors (SSVs) by
                  writing to the Short Stroke register (9EE8h).
                  CMD_LINE draws a vector of length MAJ_AXIS_PCNT (96E8h)
                  in the direction specified by LINEDIR (bits 5-7).
        4  DRAW. If clear the current position is moved, but no pixels
           are modified. This bit should be set when attempting read or
           write of bitmap data.
      5-7  LINEDIR. When a line draw command (CMD_LINE) with LINETYPE=1
           is issued, these bits define the direction of the line
           counter clockwise relative to the positive X-axis.
             0 = 000 degrees
             1 = 045 degrees
             2 = 090 degrees
             3 = 135 degrees
             4 = 180 degrees
             5 = 225 degrees
             6 = 270 degrees
             7 = 315 degrees
        5  INC_X. This bit together with INC_Y determines which quadrant
           the slope of a line lies within. They also determine the
           orientation of rectangle draw commands.
           If set lines are drawn in the positive X direction (left to right).
        6  YMAJAXIS. For Bresenham line drawing commands this bit determines
           which axis is the independent or major axis. INC_X and INC_Y
           determines which quadrant the slope falls within. This bit further
           defines the slope to within an octant.
           If set Y is the major (independent) axis.
        7  INC_Y. This bit together with INC_X determines which quadrant
           the slope of a line lies within. They also determine the
           orientation of rectangle draw commands.
           If set lines are drawn in the positive Y direction (down).
        8  (Pixel Data Enable) PCDATA.
           If set the drawing engine waits for read/write of the PIX_TRANS
           register (E2E8h) for each pixel during a draw operation.
        9  16BIT. If set the PIX_TRANS register (E2E8h) is processed
           internally as two bytes in the order specified by BYTSEQ.
           If clear all accesses are 8bit.
    10-11  Reserved(0)
       12  Byte Sequence (BYTSEQ). Affects both reads and writes of
           SHORT_STROKE (9EE8h) and PIX_TRANS (E2E8h) when 16bit=1.
           If set take low byte first, if clear take high byte first.
    13-15  Draw Command:
            0 = CMD_NOP.    (Should be used for Short Stroke Vectors).
            1 = CMD_LINE  
            2 = CMD_RECT    (Fill rectangle in X direction)
            3 = CMD_RECTV1  (Fill rectangle in Y direction)
            4 = CMD_RECTV2  (Fast filled Y direction rectangle)
            5 = CMD_LINEAF  (Outline)

            7 = illegal

9EE8h W(R/W):  Short Stroke Vector Transfer Register (SHORT_STROKE)
bit   0-3  Length of vector projected onto the major axis.
           This is also the number of pixels drawn.
        4  Must be set for pixels to be written.
      5-7  VECDIR. The angle measured counter-clockwise from horizontal
           right) at which the line is drawn,
             0 = 000 degrees
             1 = 045 degrees
             2 = 090 degrees
             3 = 135 degrees
             4 = 180 degrees
             5 = 225 degrees
             6 = 270 degrees
             7 = 315 degrees
     8-15  The lower 8 bits are duplicated in the upper 8 bits so two
           short stroke vectors can be drawn with one command.
Note: The upper byte must be written for the SSV command to be executed.
      Thus if a byte is written to 9EE8h another byte must be written to 
      9EE9h before execution starts. A single 16bit write will do.
      If only one SSV is desired the other byte can be set to 0.

           of the PIX_CNTL register.
           If the result of the comparison is true, the destination data
           is left unchanged.
