  IBM XGA      1024*768 interlaced
  IBM XGA-NI   1024*768 Non-interlaced

All register accesses happen through a block of 16 registers starting
at a adapter dependant register (called xga in the following).
The register xga+0Ah works as an indexed register i.e.. xga+0Ah is the
index register and xga+0Bh is the data register.

Also a block of 128 bytes memory mapped registers exists, primarily used for
the accelerator functions.

General note:
When writing to XGA registers undefined bits must be set to 0 unless
otherwise specified. When reading the undefined bits may be truly undefined,
i.e. random.

0100h  W(R):  Identification Word

             8FDAh = The IBM XGA-NI.
             8FDBh = Original IBM XGA
             (8FD8h-8FDBh is reserved for IBM XGA's).
           VESA defines the following ranges for XGA compatible boards:
             240h-27Fh, 830h-0A7F, 0A90h-0BFFh and 8FD0h-8FD3h(reserved)

           only the POS registers (100h-105h) can be accessed.
      1-3  INSTANCE. IDs the particular XGA adapter (there can be up to 8 in
           a system). This value is used to define the XGA base address
           (21x0h) and which 128 byte block of the 1KB external memory the
           memory mapped registers are located in.
      4-7  EXT_MEM_ADDR. Defines the address the 8KB (usually 7KB ROM and 1KB
           dedicated to XGA memory mapped registers) external memory is mapped
           to:
             0 = 0C000h,  1 = 0C2000h,  2 = 0C4000h,  3 = 0C6000h

           address. Bit 22-24 is taken from the INSTANCE field of register

           Status register (21x5h bit 7) is set. 
        7  BUSY. If set the XGA drawing engine is busy. You should not write
           to any memory registers while this bit is set. On the XGA-NI you
           should check the AUX_BUSY bit of the Auxiliary Status Register
           (Memory 9h bit 7), as reading this register will temporarily stop
           the drawing engine.

Memory 12h  (W):  Pixel Map Index

                 inside the rectangle AND the corresponding bit in the map is
                 1. 
    12-15  PATT_SRC. Selects the pattern.
             1 = Pixel Map A, 2 = Pixel Map B, 3 = pixel Map C,
             8 = Always ForeGround, 9 = Pattern from source data.
           The pattern selects whether the ForeGround or background data is
           used for the drawing operation.
    16-19  DST_MAP. Selects the destination map.
             1 = Pixel Map A, 2 = Pixel Map B, 3 = Pixel Map C
    20-23  SRC_MAP. Selects the source map.
             1 = Pixel Map A, 2 = Pixel Map B, 3 = Pixel Map C
    24-27  COMMAND. The draw command:
             2  = Short Stroke Read.
             3  = Line Draw Read.
             4  = Short Stroke Write. Puts the XGA in Short stroke mode.
                  All actual draws happen by writes to the Short Stroke
                  register.
             5  = Line Draw Write. Writes a line in the destination map.
                  Line direction and length are set in the Bresenham and
                  Direction 1 registers.
             8  = BitBLT. 
             9  = Inverting BitBLT.
            0Ah = Area Fill.
    28-29  FORE_SRC. The source of the ForeGround mix operation:
               0 = Foreground color, 2 = Source Pixel Map.
           The ForeGround source is effective when a pattern map is used, and
           the corresponding bit in the pattern is 1, or when the pattern
           source is given as Foreground.
    30-31  BACK_SRC. The source of the background mix operation:
               0 = Background color, 2 = Source Pixel Map.
           The background source is effective when a pattern map is used, and
           the corresponding bit in the pattern is 0.




  Video Modes:
   
    640x480   256 colors
    640x480 65536 colors
    800x600    16 colors
    800x600   256 colors
    800x600 65536 colors  
   1024x768    16 colors
   1024x768   256 colors
    
   
   All modes use a linear address mode, where bits 16-23 of the address 
   are in the Video Aperture Index register (xga+8), and the lower 16 bits 
   are the offset from 0A000:0.

   In 16 color modes two pixels are stored in each byte. Even pixels are in
   bits 0-3 and odd pixels in bits 4-7.
   Address of pixel = (row *(pixels per row)+column) /2.

   In 256 color modes each pixel occupies a byte. The pixels are addressed
   in linear fashion. Address of pixel = row *(pixels per row) + column.

   In 65536 color modes each pixel occupies two bytes.
   Address of pixel = (row *(pixels per row)+column)*2.
