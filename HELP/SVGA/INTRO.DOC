Introduction.

These files are what I have been able to collect of information on
the various Super VGA cards and other display adapters.
The information should be regarded with a healthy dose of sceptism
as I have been unable to test most of it.
Hopefully it will be of use to you all.


Terminology/style:

The BIOS calls are mostly taken directly from Ralf's interrupt list
and tends to follow its style and structure.

The register descriptions are sorted by the register number.

All register addresses, data values etc are given in hexadecimal.

3d4h means 3D4h when in color mode and 3B4h when in monochrome mode.

3CEh index 3 means register 3CEh is set to 3 and register 3CFh is the
     data port. See notes on register 3C0h under VGA registers.
     On some cards write operations can be done with a single OUTW
     instruction. This may fail on some cards or machines.
     ATI cards require the index to be updated before each access to
     the dataport.

(R)   means the register is Read Only.
(W)   means the register is Write Only.
(R/W) means the register is both Readable and Writable.
(r/W) means the register is Write Only on EGA cards and Read/Writable
      on VGA cards.


The examples are in Turbo Pascal for readability.
For non Turbo users $1234 is hex 01234h and port[$3cd]:= is an OUT
to register 03CDh and port[$3cd] (in an expression) is an IN from
register 03CDh.
