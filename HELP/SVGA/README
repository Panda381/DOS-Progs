This is the official release version of VGADOC3, the most comprehensive
collection on (Super)VGA and other video adapter programming available.


This is a collection of programming information on (Super)VGA chipsets,
not an introduction to video/graphics programming.

The major changes from version 2 are:
Hualon, UMC, Weitek, PCVideo and Targa coverage is new.
The material on Cirrus, Compaq and XGA is vastly expanded.
The cards, clocks, history and q&a files are new.
The coverage of Hardware Cursor, BitBLT, Line Draw and Read/Write
 banks in WHATVGA is new
The coverage of Hi/Truecolor RAMDACs is greatly expanded.

Programs & source files:

  All source is in pascal (except VESALIE.as).
  The source files can be compiled with Turbo Pascal 5.5 or Borland
  Pascal 7.0. Other versions will probably work, but ...

  The assembler source (Vesalie.as) can be assembled with a86.com





I'ld be very interested in any information you may be able to supply,
whether as new information, corrections or suggestions.

Any contributors and testers will be given credit in future versions.
Please specify if you have special requests as to names or addresses
used (or not used).



While I'll try to answer all queries, experience shows that I sometimes
have trouble keeping up (I have this nasty habit of working 75 hour weeks).

Generally ongoing test sessions, new information/corrections and intelligent
queries (my decision) will get priority.
