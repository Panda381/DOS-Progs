Command line switches:

  whatvga [+acumos] [-ncr] [=1024] [/a]

  where +chipset  forces WHATVGA to proceed as if this chipset was found.
                  The test for this chip set will be executed in order
                  to check for memory and revision.
                  No other chipsets will be tested.

        -chipset  ensures that the tests for this chipset will NOT be
                  executed. Useful if a chipset is misidentified
                  or some earlier test gives problems.

        =kbytes   Forces the number of Kbytes of video RAM on the
                  adapter to the specified value.
        
        /a        Run automatic test and write results to a file.
                  The user responds with Y or N to each test and can
                  enter comments to the individual tests.
                  On startup you may be asked to select the video system
                  to test (say if you have a VESA driver loaded).
                  If the program seems to halt for more than a few seconds
                  try to press the enter key.

                  The recommanded way to use the program is to start it
                  with no command line parameters and play with it a bit.
                  See that the chipset, memory and DAC are ID'd properly
                  and that you can display at least some super VGA modes.
                  Then run the program with /a to do the full test.
                  For the /a test, the system should be as "clean" as
                  possible, as TSRs (including mouse and keyboard drivers)
                  and memory managers can sometimesaffect the results.
                  Try booting from a floppy.

                  Comments should only be entered when something is wrong
                  or needs clarification. Ie. there is no need to enter
                  "Fine" or "All ok" thats what the yes/no queries are for.
                  When something is wrong try to be as descriptive as
                  possible (remember, I can't see the screen).

Note that the files CHIPS.LST and WHATVGA.LST must be in the current
directory for WHATVGA to functiion.

If you have problems with the identification/startup:

 - The screen goes blank or all white...
   Try to run: WHATVGA /d
   This will display the name of each chipset and waits for
   you to press the Enter key BEFORE the chipset is tested.
   When you have found the offending chipsets, try to run:
     WHATVGA -Chips&Tech     (assuming Chips&Tech is the one)
   Report the problem.

 - The chipset is misidentified.
   Try to run: WHATVGA -chipset

 - Memory Size is identified wrong.
   Run WHATVGA =2048    (or how many Kbytes you have)
   Report the problem.


Whatvga has 6 options in the main menu:

  1 Test standard VGA

    Allows you to test the standard VGA video modes.
    Draws a test pattern, including a color palette
    and writes basic information as text on the display.

    See 2) for the details.

  2 Test extended modes

    Allows you to test the extended video modes of the adapter.
    Draws a test pattern, including a color palette
    and writes basic information as text on the display.
    On the upper and left edge every hundred pixels is marked.

    when you press a key the testpattern is drawn again, this time
    in the largest size the available video memory will support
    ("Virtual Screen"), allowing you to scroll around in the display
    using the arrow keys. You should be able to move in the entire
    pattern, but not to move so far right or down that the display wraps. 
    If you can move past the right edge (or can't reach it) then the
    scroll function probably needs a factor 2 (divide or multiply)
    in the SetVStart function.

    When you press the Enter key a textscreen is shown with the
    statistics for the mode, this screen also shown if the rutine
    to analyse the mode from the register values (AnalyseMode) reaches
    the same result. If not the values are shown as "Calculated".

    By pressing "d" or "D" you can see a dump of all the VGA (and extended)
    registers. The registers can be saved (appended) to the file REGISTER.VGA
    by pressing "f" or "F".

  3 Search for modes

    Sequentially attempts to set modes 14h to 7Fh, each time testing
    if the mode was succesfully set. If so the testpattern is drawn
    and the mode is analysed.
    

  5 Hardware Cursor test

    This item attempts to place a 32x32 hardware Cursor in the
    selected mode. The cursor can be moved around on the screen
    with the arrow keys.

  6 BitBLT test

    This item first draws the testpattern, then draws the color palette
    with BitBLT operations, then makes two blockcopies via BitBLT of
    the two palettes, and finally draws a series of rectangles each smaller
    than the last to test precision (you need to press a key for each box)


  7 Line Draw test

    This item attempts to draw lines from the center of the screen
    in a "wheel" using different colors.

  8 Read/Write bank test

    This item copies the area with the color palette to the lower half
    of the screen using seperate read/write banks.

  0 Exit

  Items 5-8 are only present if I believe the adapter supports the function,
  though you can always try the test by pressing the key.


  Special functions for test purposes (may hang your PC or worse):

  B Register Bit test.

    You are asked for the base register (such as 3C0h, 3C4h, 3CEh or
    3d4h), starting index and starting bit number (0-7).
    Then you select the mode for the test.

    Now the test pattern is drawn in the desired mode, but using the
    entire video memory (like the "virtual screen").
    The selected bit will be changed for ~0.5 sec, then restored for
    another 0.5 sec. This repeats until another bit is selected by
    -, + or * or the test is stopped by the Esc key.

    This can be used figure out the function of individual bits, the
    Display Start extension bits being the obvious example (and the
    intended target), but also clock bits etc.

    !!NOTE!! this may hang your PC or expose your video card or monitor
    to conditions beoynd their intended operational specifications.
    While damage to your monitor or video card is extremely unlikely
    (I haven't heard of a confirmed case since the old IBM MDA monitor),
    it is theoretically possible and my insurence company refuses to
    recognize any responsibility what so ever :-).

    Hanging your PC is however a very real possibility.
    Note the bit you were testing, reboot (power off may be required)
    and restart from the NEXT bit.

  D DAC 6/8 bit test

    A test pattern is drawn in the selected 256color mode.
    The palette is set up to use the full 256 of 16m palette (256
    shades of each basic color). When the DAC is in 6bit mode there
    are only 64 shades, thus the color bars will "break".
    The keys 6 and 8 switches between 6bit and 8bit DAC mode
    (if the 8bit DAC mode works :-) ).
    Esc or Enter terminater the test.
    Currently this only works for the AT&T,Brooktree and Sierra 24bit DACs.



The tests:

ID:      Is the Chip Set, DAC and video memory identified correctly?

Xres:    Are the modes (standard and extended) displayed correctly?
         Display type, Switch settings and BIOS versions can cause
         some modes to be unavailable or out of sync.

Scrl:    Can you display and scroll in the Virtual Screen ?
         You should be able to move in the entire virtual screen,
         but not to move so far right or down that the display wraps.
         If you can move past the right edge (or can't reach it)
         we probably miss a factor of two in the SetVStart function.
         If the display wraps when the start crosses the middle (or 1/4)
         of memory we have a problem with the high bits (the Y variable)
         in the SetVStart function or with an enable bit.
         Also part of video memory can be inaccessible in modes that
         normally only use <half the memory causing the testpattern to
         be overwritten.
    
Anal:    Are the modes (particularly the extended ones) analysed
         correctly (Ie are there no "Calculated" fields) ?        
         Some modes, such as 2 and 4 color and mode 13h are
         hard to ID on many adapters.

Cur:     Is the HardWare cursor shown correctly and can it be moved
         around the display with the arrow keys ?
         The cursor should look like a snipers sights with a dot in the
         upper left corner.

Blit:    Is the second palette drawn correctly ? Are the palettes
         copied correctly ? Are the boxes placed correctly
         (each one pixels smaller in each direction) ?

Line:    Are the lines drawn from the middle to fill a rectangle ?

RWbank:  Is the palette (and text) copied correctly ?

(15 bits) and the "Mark3" SC11485/7/9 (15/16 bits) RAMDACs.

Search for modes doesn't understand 2 and 4 color modes.
In general 2 and 4 color modes are only supported partially.

Mode 0Fh and 11h (and other 2 color modes) has problems in some cases.

Mode 13h has a pixel double function. Most chips use Master Clock/2
(3C4h index 1 bit 3) for this, but some chips has their own system.

Some of the extended modes may only be implemented on
some otherwise similar boards, depending on make and BIOS rev.


Utilities:

DMPMEM:

  DMPMEM dumps the ROMs to files named DMPxxxx.ROM (where xxxx is
  the hex address of the ROM Ie. DMPC000.ROM for VGA).
  Interrupt and Font addresses are saved to the file VECTORS.ROM
  As Mouse drivers, national keyboard drivers, memory managers
  etc can obscure the results the program should be run on a clean
  system (empty CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT say from a floppy).


TABLE:

  Takes the register sets dumped to the file REGISTER.VGA and writes
  them to REGISTER.TBL. If a register has the same value in all register
  sets, the value is only shown the first time.
  As the same file names are used every time you will have to delete
  and rename the files as needed.


VESALIE:

  Can change the version and amount of memory reported by your VESA driver.
  Can also hide the VESA driver, so other applications don't see it.
  Parameters:  /0 /1 /2  Makes the VESA driver report a specific VESA
                         VBE version (1.00, 1.01 or 1.02).
               /on /off  Turns the VESA VBE on or off. By turning the
                         VBE off you can prevent applications from using
                         the VESA interface. Also if you try to load
                         another VESA driver, it may refuse to install
                         while the original driver is visible.
               /Mxx      Forces the VESA driver to report the specified
                         amount (in Kbytes) of video memory.
               /U        Unload the VESALIE program.

  Note that this NOT a VESA driver, it just changes the behavior of
  an already installed driver.


SHOWTEST:

  Analyses the results in the .tst files generated when WHATVGA is
  run with the /a option (WHVGAxxx.TST).
  Parameters: SHOWTEST [tstfil] [outfil] [/r]
  When run without parameters it lists the test files in the current
  directory, showing the filename, chipset, memory, DAC and chipname.
  When run with the name of a test file, the test results in this file
  are written to the outfile. If no outfile is specified, the name of
  the test file is used, with the extension changed to .txt
  If the /r switch is used the register dumps for each mode is written
  to the outfile (or to .reg).
