    For the 82c452 & 3  the window to display memory can start on
    any boundary fitting the granularity of the chip/display mode.
    When using 2 bank registers, the address range available to the
    adapter is split equally between the two bank registers. I.e.
    A000h-A7FFh uses one bank, and A800h-AFFFh the other.
    (Or A000h-AFFFh and B000h-BFFFh respectively if using the full
    128 Kbytes range).
