                                    GOTO
 
Directs MS-DOS to a line in a batch program that is marked by a label you
specify. You can use this command only in batch programs.
 
The GOTO command directs MS-DOS within a batch program to a line identified
by a label. When MS-DOS finds the label, it processes the commands beginning
on the next line.
 
Syntax
 
    GOTO label
 
Parameters
 
label
    Specifies the line in a batch program to which MS-DOS should go.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                GOTOฤฤNotes
 
Valid values for label
 
The label parameter cannot include separators such as spaces, semicolons or
equal signs.
 
GOTO uses the first eight characters of each label
 
The GOTO command uses only the first eight characters of a label. Therefore,
the labels "hithere01" and "hithere02" are both equivalent to "hithere0".
 
Matching the label parameter with the label in the batch program
 
The label value you specify on the GOTO command line must match a label in
the batch program. The label within the batch program must be preceded by a
colon.
 
If your batch program does not contain the label that you specify, the batch
program stops and MS-DOS displays the following message:
 
    Label not found
 
MS-DOS recognizes a batch-program line beginning with a colon (:) as a label
and does not process it as a command. If a line begins with a colon, MS-DOS
ignores any commands on that line.
 
Using GOTO for conditional operations
 
GOTO is often used on the same command line with other commands to perform
conditional operations. For more information about using GOTO for
conditional operations, see the <IF> command.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                               GOTOฤฤExample
 
The following batch program formats a disk in drive A as a system disk. If
the operation is successful, the GOTO command directs MS-DOS to a label
named "end".
 
    echo off
    format a: /s
    if not errorlevel 1 goto end
    echo An error occurred during formatting.
    :end
    echo Successfully formatted the disk in drive A.

                                  GRAPHICS
 
Loads a program into memory that allows MS-DOS to print the information
displayed on your screen. Use the GRAPHICS command only if you are using a
color or graphics adapter.
 
The GRAPHICS command supports the CGA, EGA, and VGA graphics display modes.
 
Syntax
 
    GRAPHICS [type] [[drive:][path]filename] [/R] [/B] [/LCD]
    [/PRINTBOX:STD|/PRINTBOX:LCD]
 
Parameters
 
type
    Specifies the type of printer. The following list shows each valid value
    for this parameter and gives a brief description of its meaning:
 
    COLOR1
        An IBM Personal Computer Color Printer with black ribbon
 
    COLOR4
        An IBM Personal Computer Color Printer with RGB (red, green, blue,
        and black) ribbon
 
    COLOR8
        An IBM Personal Computer Color Printer with CMY (cyan, magenta,
        yellow, and black) ribbon
 
    HPDEFAULT
        Any Hewlett-Packard PCL printer
 
    DESKJET
        A Hewlett-Packard DeskJet printer
 
    GRAPHICS
        An IBM Personal Graphics Printer, IBM Proprinter, or IBM Quietwriter
        printer
 
    GRAPHICSWIDE
        An IBM Personal Graphics Printer with an 11-inch-wide carriage
 
    LASERJET
        A Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer
 
    LASERJETII
        A Hewlett-Packard LaserJet II printer
 
    PAINTJET
        A Hewlett-Packard PaintJet printer
 
    QUIETJET
        A Hewlett-Packard QuietJet printer
 
    QUIETJETPLUS
        A Hewlett-Packard QuietJet Plus printer
 
    RUGGEDWRITER
        A Hewlett-Packard RuggedWriter printer
 
    RUGGEDWRITERWIDE
        A Hewlett-Packard RuggedWriterwide printer
 
    THERMAL
        An IBM PC-convertible Thermal Printer
 
    THINKJET
        A Hewlett-Packard ThinkJet printer
 
[drive:][path]filename
    Specifies the location and name of the printer profile that contains
    information about all supported printers. If this parameter is omitted,
    MS-DOS looks for a file called GRAPHICS.PRO in the current directory and
    in the directory that contains the GRAPHICS.COM file.
 
Switches
 
/R
    Prints the image as it appears on the screen (white characters on a
    black background) rather than reversed (black characters on a white
    background). The latter occurs by default.
 
/B
    Prints the background in color. This switch is valid for COLOR4 and
    COLOR8 printers.
 
/LCD
    Prints an image by using the liquid crystal display (LCD) aspect ratio
    instead of the CGA aspect ratio. The effect of this switch is the same
    as that of /PRINTBOX:LCD.
 
/PRINTBOX:STD or /PRINTBOX:LCD
    Selects the print-box size. Check the first operand of the PRINTBOX
    statement in your GRAPHICS.PRO file. If that operand is STD, specify the
    /PRINTBOX:STD switch. If that operand is LCD, specify the /PRINTBOX:LCD
    switch. You can abbreviate PRINTBOX as PB.

ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                              GRAPHICSฤฤNotes
 
Printing the contents of the screen
 
To print the contents of the screen, press the SHIFT+PRINT SCREEN key
combination. If the computer is in 320 x 148 x 200 color graphics mode and
if the printer type is color1 or graphics, the GRAPHICS command prints the
screen contents with as many as four shades of gray. If the computer is in
640 x 148 x 200 color graphics mode, GRAPHICS prints the screen contents
sideways on the paper (landscape orientation). You cannot use the
SHIFT+PRINT SCREEN key combination to print the contents of a screen to a
PostScript printer.
 
Effect on memory
 
The GRAPHICS command decreases the amount of available conventional memory.
 
Loading a new profile
 
If you have already loaded a printer profile and you want to load another
one by using the GRAPHICS command, the new profile must be smaller than the
one already loaded.
 
To load a new profile that is larger than the one currently loaded, you must
restart your system and then use the GRAPHICS command to load the new
profile.
 
If you try to use only the GRAPHICS command to load a new profile that is
larger than the currently loaded profile, MS-DOS displays the following
message:
 
    Unable to reload with profile supplied
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                             GRAPHICSฤฤExample
 
To prepare to print a graphics screen on your printer, type the following
command:
 
    graphics
 
After you display the information you want to print, press SHIFT+PRINT
SCREEN. MS-DOS scans the information displayed on the screen and sends it to
the printer.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                    HELP
 
Starts MS-DOS Help.
 
Syntax
 
    HELP [/B] [/G] [/H] [/NOHI] [topic]
 
Switches
 
/B
    Allows use of a monochrome monitor with a color graphics card.
 
/G
    Provides the fastest update of a CGA screen.
 
/H
    Displays the maximum number of lines possible for your hardware.
 
/NOHI
    Allows the use of a monitor without high-intensity support.
 
Parameter
 
topic
    Specifies the command whose help topic you want to display.

                               HELPฤฤExample
 
To display information about the COPY command, type the following at the
command prompt:
 
    help copy
 
To display the MS-DOS Help table of contents, type HELP. From the table of
contents, you can choose the command topic you want to view.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                 HIMEM.SYS
 
HIMEM is an extended-memory managerฤฤa program that coordinates the use of
your computer's extended memory, including the high memory area (HMA), so
that no two applications or device drivers use the same memory at the same
time.
 
You install HIMEM by adding a <DEVICE> command for HIMEM.SYS to your
CONFIG.SYS file. The HIMEM.SYS command line must come before any commands
that start applications or device drivers that use extended memory; for
example, the HIMEM.SYS command line must come before the EMM386.EXE command
line.
 
Syntax
 
    DEVICE=[drive:][path]HIMEM.SYS [/A20CONTROL:ON|OFF] [/CPUCLOCK:ON|OFF]
    [/EISA] [/HMAMIN=m] [/INT15=xxxx] [/NUMHANDLES=n] [/MACHINE:xxxx]
    [/SHADOWRAM:ON|OFF] [/TESTMEM:ON|OFF] [/VERBOSE]
 
In most cases, you won't need to specify command-line options. The default
values for HIMEM.SYS are designed to work with most hardware.
 
Parameter
 
[drive:][path]
    Specifies the location of the HIMEM.SYS file. HIMEM.SYS should always be
    located on the same drive that contains your MS-DOS files. If the
    HIMEM.SYS file is in the root directory of your startup drive, you don't
    need to include a path. However, you must always include the complete
    filename (HIMEM.SYS).
 
Switches
 
/A20CONTROL:ON|OFF
    Specifies whether HIMEM is to take control of the A20 line even if A20
    was on when HIMEM was loaded. The A20 handler gives your computer access
    to the HMA. If you specify /A20CONTROL:OFF, HIMEM takes control of the
    A20 line only if A20 was off when HIMEM was loaded. The default setting
    is /A20CONTROL:ON.
 
/CPUCLOCK:ON|OFF
    Specifies whether HIMEM is to affect the clock speed of your computer.
    If your computer's clock speed changes when you install HIMEM,
    specifying /CPUCLOCK:ON may correct the problem; however, enabling this
    option slows down HIMEM. The default setting is /CPUCLOCK:OFF.
 
/EISA
    Specifies that HIMEM should allocate all available extended memory. This
    switch is necessary only on an EISA (Extended Industry Standard
    Architecture) computer with more than 16 MB of memory; on other
    computers, HIMEM automatically allocates all available extended memory.
 
/HMAMIN=m
    Specifies how many kilobytes of memory an application must require for
    HIMEM to give that application use of the HMA. Only one application can
    use the HMA at a time; HIMEM allocates the HMA to the first application
    that meets the memory-use requirements set by this option. You can
    specify a value from 0 to 63.
 
    Set /HMAMIN to the amount of memory required by the application that
    uses the most HMA memory.
 
    The /HMAMIN option is not required; the default value is zero. Omitting
    this option (or setting it to zero) specifies that HIMEM allocate the
    HMA to the first application that requests it, regardless of how much of
    the HMA the application is going to use.
 
    The /HMAMIN option has no effect when Windows is running in 386 enhanced
    mode.
 
/INT15=xxxx
    Allocates the amount of extended memory (in kilobytes) to be reserved
    for the Interrupt 15h interface. Some older applications use the
    Interrupt 15h interface to allocate extended memory rather than using
    the XMS (eXtended-Memory Specification) method provided by HIMEM. If you
    use these applications, you can ensure enough memory is available to
    them by setting xxxx to 64 KB larger than the amount required by the
    application.
 
    You can specify a value from 64 to 65535; however, you cannot specify
    more memory than your system has available. If you specify a value less
    than 64, the value becomes 0. The default value is 0.
 
/NUMHANDLES=n
    Specifies the maximum number of extended-memory block (EMB) handles that
    can be used simultaneously. You can specify a value from 1 to 128; the
    default value is 32. Each additional handle requires an additional 6
    bytes of memory.
 
    The /NUMHANDLES option has no effect when Windows is running in 386
    enhanced mode.
 
/MACHINE:xxxx
    Specifies what type of computer you are using. Usually, HIMEM can detect
    your computer type successfully; however, there are a few computers that
    HIMEM cannot detect. On such systems, HIMEM uses the default system type
    (IBM AT or compatible). You might need to include the /MACHINE option if
    your computer is a type that HIMEM cannot detect and if HIMEM does not
    work properly on your system by using the default system type.
 
    Currently, systems that require this option include Acer 1100, Wyse, and
    IBM 7552.
 
    The value for xxxx can be any of the codes or their equivalent numbers
    listed in the following table.
 
Code         Number  Computer type

/SHADOWRAM:ON|OFF
    Specifies whether to disable shadow RAM (SHADOWRAM:OFF) or to leave the
    ROM code running from RAM (SHADOWRAM:ON).
 
    Some computers make ROM code run faster by "shadowing" it in RAMฤฤthat
    is, by copying the ROM code into faster RAM memory at startup, which
    uses some extended memory. On computers that use shadow RAM and have
    less than 2 MB of RAM, HIMEM usually attempts to disable shadow RAM to
    recover additional extended memory for Windows to use. (HIMEM can
    disable shadow RAM only on certain types of systems.) When HIMEM
    disables shadow RAM, the ROM code runs in the slower ROM instead of RAM;
    therefore, your computer might run slightly slower than it did before.
 
/TESTMEM:ON|OFF
    Determines whether HIMEM performs a memory test when your computer
    starts. By default, HIMEM tests the reliability of your computer's
    extended memory each time your computer starts. This test can identify
    memory that is no  longer reliable; unreliable memory can cause system
    instability or loss of data. HIMEM's memory test is more thorough than
    the standard power-up memory test performed by most computers. To
    prevent HIMEM from performing the memory test, specify /TESTMEM:OFF.
    Disabling the memory test will shorten the startup process. (The default
    setting is /TESTMEM:ON.)
 
/VERBOSE
    Directs HIMEM to display status and error messages while loading. By
    default, HIMEM does not display any messages unless it encounters an
    error. You can abbreviate /VERBOSE as /V. (To display status messages
    without adding the /VERBOSE switch, press and hold the ALT key while
    HIMEM starts and loads.)
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                              HIMEM.SYSฤฤNotes
 
HIMEM tests the reliability of your extended memory
 
The MS-DOS 6.2 version of HIMEM.SYS includes a new safety feature: it tests
your computer's extended memory each time your computer starts. HIMEM tests
the memory by writing and reading data to each memory address and checking
for differences in the data. If the data HIMEM reads from an address differs
from the data it just wrote to that address, then the memory at that address
is unreliable. Unreliable memory can cause system instability or loss of
data. HIMEM's memory test is more thorough than the standard power-up memory
test performed by most computers.
 
If HIMEM detects unreliable memory, it displays the following message and
does not load:
 
    ERROR: HIMEM.SYS has detected unreliable extended memory at address
    XXXXXXXXh.
 
If you receive this message, you should have your computer's memory checked
by a qualified computer hardware technician. Although you can disable the
memory test and load HIMEM by using the /TESTMEM:OFF switch, it's not
advisable to do so until you have had the memory checked by a technician.
 
Default memory allocation
 
Only one program at a time can use the high memory area (HMA). If you omit
the /HMAMIN=m switch (or set it to 0), HIMEM reserves the HMA for the first
program that requests it and that meets the memory requirements set by the
/HMAMIN=m switch. To ensure the most efficient use of your system's high
memory area, set /HMAMIN=m to the amount of memory required by the program
that uses the most HMA memory.
 
Loading MS-DOS into the high memory area
 
HIMEM or another XMS driver must be loaded in order to load MS-DOS into the
high memory area (HMA). You load MS-DOS into the HMA by using the DOS=HIGH
command in your CONFIG.SYS file. (The DOS=HIGH command can appear anywhere
in the CONFIG.SYS file.)
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                            HIMEM.SYSฤฤExamples
 
To run HIMEM using the default values, add the following command line to
your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    device=himem.sys
 
The command line shown above does not specify a path for the HIMEM.SYS file;
therefore, MS-DOS searches for the HIMEM.SYS file only in the root directory
of your startup drive. Because this command line does not include additional
options, HIMEM uses the default values for those options. HIMEM allocates
the HMA to the first program that requests it and allows the simultaneous
use of up to 32 extended-memory handles.
 
Increasing the number of memory handles that HIMEM provides
 
To specify that a maximum of 128 extended-memory handles can be used
simultaneously, add the following command line to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    device=c:\dos\himem.sys /numhandles=128

ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                     IF
 
Performs conditional processing in batch programs. If the condition
specified by an IF command is true, MS-DOS carries out the command that
follows the condition. If the condition is false, MS-DOS ignores the
command. You can use this command only in batch programs.
 
Syntax
 
    IF [NOT] ERRORLEVEL number command
 
    IF [NOT] string1==string2 command
 
    IF [NOT] EXIST filename command
 
Parameters
 
NOT
    Specifies that MS-DOS should carry out the command only if the condition
    is false.
 
ERRORLEVEL number
    Specifies a true condition only if the previous program run by
    COMMAND.COM returned an exit code equal to or greater than number.
 
command
    Specifies the command that MS-DOS should carry out if the preceding
    condition is met.
 
string1==string2
    Specifies a true condition only if string1 and string2 are the same.
    These values can be literal strings or batch variables (%1, for
    example). Literal strings do not need quotation marks.
 
EXIST filename
    Specifies a true condition if filename exists.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                IFฤฤExamples
 
The following example tests for the existence of a directory. The IF command
cannot be used to test directly for a directory, but the null (NUL) device
does exist in every directory on the hard drive. Therefore, you can test for
the null device to determine whether a directory exists on the hard drive.
 
    if exist c:\mydir\nul goto process
 
The following example displays the message "Can't find data file" if MS-DOS
cannot find the file PRODUCT.DAT:
 
    if not exist product.dat echo Can't find data file
 
When a program stops, it returns an exit code to MS-DOS. For example, a
value of 0 is typically used to indicate that a program was successfully
executed. The ERRORLEVEL parameter lets you use exit codes as conditions.
 
The following example displays an error message if an error occurs during
formatting of the disk in drive A. If no error occurs, the error message is

                                  INCLUDE
 
Includes the contents of one configuration block within another. You can use
this command only in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
The INCLUDE command is one of six special CONFIG.SYS commands used for
defining multiple configurations within a single CONFIG.SYS file. With
multiple configurations, you define a menu that appears when your computer
starts. Each menu item corresponds to a block of commands, or "configuration
block," in your CONFIG.SYS file. For more information about multiple
configurations and configuration blocks, see the chapter "Configuring Your
System" in the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
Syntax
 
    INCLUDE=blockname
 
Parameter
 
blockname
    Specifies the name of the configuration block to include.
 
Related Commands
 
The INCLUDE command is one of six special CONFIG.SYS commands for defining
multiple configurations. The other commands are for defining the startup
menu, and are as follows:
 
  The <MENUITEM> command, which defines an item on the menu.
 
  The <MENUDEFAULT> command, which specifies the default menu item.
 
  The <MENUCOLOR> command, which defines the color of the menu's text and
   screen background.
 
  The <SUBMENU> command, which defines a submenu.
 
  The <NUMLOCK> command, which specifies the state of the NUM LOCK key when
   the startup menu appears. (Although NUMLOCK can be used anywhere in the
   CONFIG.SYS file, it is especially useful when defining a startup menu.)

                             INCLUDEฤฤExamples
 
The following CONFIG.SYS file defines three configurations:
 
    [menu]
    menuitem=base_config, Base configuration only
    menuitem=full_config, Normal configuration
    menuitem=net_config, Normal configuration with network
 
    [base_config]
    dos=high
    device=c:\dos\himem.sys
 
    [full_config]
    include=base_config
    dos=umb
    device=c:\dos\emm386.exe ram
    devicehigh=c:\dos\ramdrive.sys 512
 
    [net_config]
    include=full_config
    devicehigh=c:\net\network.sys
 
    [common]
 
This CONFIG.SYS file contains four configuration blocks. The [base_config]
block contains two typical CONFIG.SYS commands. The [full_config] block
includes the commands in [base_config] plus the DOS=UMB command, a DEVICE
command, and a DEVICEHIGH command. The third configuration, [net_config],
includes all the commands in [full_config], which in turn includes those in
[base_config]. The [common] block appears at the end of the CONFIG.SYS file.
It is a good idea to end your CONFIG.SYS file with a [common] block so that
installation programs can successfully append commands to your CONFIG.SYS
file.

                                  INSTALL
 
Loads a memory-resident program into memory when you start MS-DOS. You can
use this command only in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
Memory-resident programs stay in memory as long as your computer is on. They
can be used even when other programs are active. You can use the INSTALL
command to load MS-DOS memory-resident programsฤฤfor example, Fastopen,
Keyb, Nlsfunc, and Share.
 
Syntax
 
    INSTALL=[drive:][path]filename [command-parameters]
 
Parameters
 
[drive:][path]filename
    Specifies the location and name of the memory-resident program you want
    to run.
 
command-parameters
    Specifies parameters for the program you specify for filename.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                               INSTALLฤฤNotes
 
INSTALL does not create an environment for a program it loads. Therefore,
slightly less memory is used if you load a program with INSTALL rather than
from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Some programs might not run correctly if they
are loaded with INSTALL. Do not use INSTALL to load programs that use
environment variables or shortcut keys or that require COMMAND.COM to be
present to handle critical errors.
 
Order of CONFIG.SYS processing
 
All INSTALL commands are processed after any of the DEVICE commands and
before the command interpreter is loaded. You cannot load a memory-resident
program before a device driver loaded with the DEVICE command.

                              INSTALLฤฤExample
 
Suppose you want to install FASTOPEN.EXE, located in the DOS directory on
drive C, from your CONFIG.SYS file instead of from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or
the command line. In addition, you want to specify that Fastopen is to track
the opening of up to 100 files and directories on drive C. To do this,
include the following command in your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    install=c:\dos\fastopen.exe c:=100
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                  INTERLNK
 
Connects two computers via parallel or serial ports and enables the
computers to share disks and printer ports. For example, you could connect a
laptop computer to a desktop computer and share files. You must install the
<INTERLNK.EXE> device driver before you can use this command.
 
Syntax
 
    INTERLNK [client[:]=[server][:]]
 
To display the current status of the Interlnk program, use the following
syntax:
 
    INTERLNK
 
Parameters
 
client
    Specifies the letter of the client drive that is redirected to a drive
    on the Interlnk server. The drive must be one that was redirected when
    you started Interlnk.
 
server
    Specifies the letter of the drive on the Interlnk server that will be
    redirected. The drive must be one listed in the This Computer (Server)
    column of the Interlnk server screen. If no drive letter is specified,
    the client drive will no longer be redirected.

                              INTERLNKฤฤNotes
 
Installing the INTERLNK.EXE device driver
 
You must use the DEVICE command to install the <INTERLNK.EXE> device driver
before you can use the INTERLNK command.
 
Canceling redirection on a drive
 
To cancel redirection of a client drive to a server drive, specify only the
client drive and the equal sign (=).
 
Starting INTERLNK without a server
 
If you use INTERLNK to connect to a computer that is not running
<INTERSVR>, INTERLNK will show the connection as three additional floppy
disk drives. However, if you try to show the contents of these drives, they
will appear empty. To show the contents of the redirected drives, the server
must be running INTERSVR.
 
Assigning drive letters
 
When you connect two computers using INTERLNK, each additional drive will be
assigned the next available drive letter. Because the <LASTDRIVE> setting in
your CONFIG.SYS file determines how many drive letters are available, make
sure LASTDRIVE is set high enough to accomodate the redirected drives.
 
Pin Connections for a Serial Cable
 
This section describes the wiring specifications for serial Interlnk
cables.
 
Make a serial cable with either a 9-pin or a 25-pin female connector on both
ends. Three wires are required for data transmission: Ground-Ground,
Transmit-Receive, and Receive- Transmit. Seven wires are required if you
want to use the remote copy feature. Wire the cable as follows:
 
9 pin           25 pin              25 pin          9 pin

Examples
 
Suppose drive E exists on a server, and INTERSVR is running. To redirect
drive G on the client to drive E on the server, type the following command:
 
    interlnk g=e
 
To cancel the redirection of client drive F, type the following command:

                                INTERLNK.EXE
 
Redirects requests for operations on one or more Interlnk client drives or
printer ports to one or more drives or printer ports on the Interlnk server.
This device driver must be loaded by a <DEVICE> or <DEVICEHIGH> command in
your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
You must install the INTERLNK.EXE device driver before you can use the
<INTERLNK> and <INTERSVR> commands.
 
Syntax
 
    DEVICE=[drive:][path]INTERLNK.EXE [/DRIVES:n] [/NOPRINTER]
    [/COM[:][n|address]] [/LPT[:][n|address]] [/AUTO] [/NOSCAN] [/LOW]
    [/BAUD:rate] [/V]
 
Parameters
 
[drive:][path]
    Specifies the location of the INTERLNK.EXE file.
 
Switches
 
/DRIVES:n
    Specifies the number of redirected drives. By default, the number is 3.
    If you specify 0 as a value for n, Interlnk redirects only printers.
 
/NOPRINTER
    Specifies that printers not be redirected when you install INTERLNK.EXE.
    By default, Interlnk redirects all available printer ports.
 
/COM[:][n|address]
    Specifies a serial port to use for data transfer. The n parameter
    specifies the number of the serial port. The address parameter specifies
    the address of the serial port. If you omit n or address, the Interlnk
    client searches all serial ports and uses the first port that it finds
    connected to the server. If you specify the /COM switch and omit the
    /LPT switch, the client searches only for serial ports. By default,
    Interlnk scans all serial and parallel ports.
 
/LPT[:][n|address]
    Specifies a parallel port to use for data transfer. The n parameter
    specifies the number of the parallel port. The address parameter
    specifies the address of the parallel port. If you omit n or address,
    the Interlnk client uses the first parallel port that it finds connected
    to the server. If you specify the /LPT switch and omit the /COM switch,
    the client searches only for parallel ports. By default, Interlnk scans
    all serial and parallel ports.
 
/AUTO
    Installs the INTERLNK.EXE device driver in memory only if the client can
    establish a connection with the server when the client starts up. By
    default, Interlnk is installed in memory even if the client cannot
    establish a connection with the server.
 
/NOSCAN
    Installs the INTERLNK.EXE device driver in memory, but prevents
    establishing a connection between client and server during setup. By
    default, the client tries to establish a connection with the server as
    soon as you install INTERLNK.EXE.
 
/LOW
    Loads the INTERLNK.EXE device driver into conventional memory, even if
    the upper memory area is available. By default, INTERLNK.EXE is loaded
    into the upper memory area if the upper memory area is available.
 
/BAUD:rate
    Sets a maximum baud rate for serial communication. Valid values for rate
    are 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200. The default is 115200.
 
/V
    Prevents conflicts with a computer's timer. Specify this switch if you
    have a serial connection between computers and one of them stops running
    when you use Interlnk to access a drive or printer port.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                            INTERLNK.EXEฤฤNotes
 
Specifying the number of drives
 
When specifying the number of redirected drives in the /DRIVES switch, make
sure the <LASTDRIVE> command in your CONFIG.SYS file is set high enough to
accomodate that number of redirected drives.
 
Loading into the upper memory area
 
By default, the Interlnk device driver is loaded into the upper memory area,
if MS-DOS 6 UMB support is enabled and memory is available. To load the
device driver in conventional memory, use the /LOW switch.
 
Position of the Interlnk command in the CONFIG.SYS file
 
The position of the DEVICE command that loads INTERLNK.EXE can affect
pre-existing drive assignments. For example, suppose your computer includes
a floppy disk drive (A), two hard disk drives (C and D), and two RAM drives
(E and F). If you load the INTERLNK.EXE device driver before installing the
RAM drives, and you choose to redirect three drives, Interlnk will assign
letters E, F, and G to the redirected drives and letters H and I to the RAM
drives. To prevent this from happening, load INTERLNK.EXE last in your
CONFIG.SYS file.

Saving memory
 
By default, the Interlnk device driver loads all its code into memory. You
can save memory by specifying the /NOPRINTER, /LPT, or /COM switch. If you
specify the /NOPRINTER switch, the Interlnk program does not load code that
redirects printers. If you specify the /LPT switch without the /COM switch,
the program does not load code that supports serial ports. If you specify
the /COM switch without the /LPT switch, the program does not load code that
supports parallel ports.
 
Using a serial mouse with Microsoft Windows
 
If you are using a serial mouse with Microsoft Windows, specify either the
/LPT switch or a /COM switch that designates a COM port other than the one
the mouse is using. For example, if the serial mouse uses COM1, and you are
using a parallel connection, specify the /LPT switch to prevent Interlnk
from scanning all COM ports.
 
Redirecting LPT1 or LPT2 and printing from Microsoft Windows
 
If you redirect LPT1 or LPT2 and print from Microsoft Windows, use Control
Panel to assign the printer to either LPT1.DOS or LPT2.DOS.

Version of MS-DOS
 
Some features of MS-DOS may not be available to the client computer if you
are running a different DOS version on your Interlnk server. For example, if
you have large partitions on your Interlnk server and are running MS-DOS 3.0
on your client, the partitions will not be available to the client because
MS-DOS 3.0 does not support them.

Running an application located on the server
 
If you use the Interlnk program to run an application located on the server,
make sure the application is configured for the computer you have designated
as the Interlnk client.
 
Limitations on using INTERLNK with other commands
 
The following commands do not work with the INTERLNK.EXE device driver:
 
    CHKDSK         FORMAT
 
    DEFRAG         MIRROR
 
    DISKCOMP       SYS
 
    DISKCOPY       UNDELETE

                           INTERLNK.EXEฤฤExamples
 
Suppose your Interlnk files are located in the DOS directory on drive C, and
you use the serial port to connect to another computer. To start Interlnk
and specify that printers not be redirected, add the following command line
to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    device=c:\dos\interlnk.exe /com /noprinter
 
To specify that Interlnk use a non-standard COM port whose address is 3F8,
add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    device=c:\dos\interlnk.exe /com:3f8

                                  INTERSVR
 
Starts the Interlnk server.
 
Syntax
 
    INTERSVR [drive:[...]] [/X=drive:[...]] [/LPT:[n|address]]
    [/COM:[n|address]] [/BAUD:rate] [/B] [/V]
 
To copy Interlnk files from one computer to another, use the following
syntax:
 
    INTERSVR /RCOPY
 
Parameter
 
drive:
    Specifies the letter(s) of the drive(s) that will be redirected. By
    default, all drives are redirected.
 
Switches
 
/X=drive:
    Specifies the letter(s) of drive(s) that will not be redirected. By
    default, all drives are redirected.
 
/LPT:[n|address]
    Specifies a parallel port to use. The n parameter specifies the number
    of the parallel port. The address parameter specifies the address of the
    parallel port. If you omit n or address, the Interlnk server uses the
    first parallel port that it finds connected to the client. If you
    specify the /LPT switch and omit the /COM switch, the server searches
    only for parallel ports. By default, all parallel and serial ports are
    scanned.
 
/COM:[n|address]
    Specifies a serial port to use. The n parameter specifies the number of
    the serial port. The address parameter specifies the address of the
    serial port. If you omit n or address, the Interlnk server searches all
    serial ports and uses the first port that it finds connected to the
    client. If you specify the /COM switch and omit the /LPT switch, the
    server searches only for serial ports. By default, all parallel and
    serial ports are scanned.
 
/BAUD:rate
    Sets a maximum serial baud rate. Valid values for rate are 9600, 19200,
    38400, 57600, and 115200. The default value is 115200.
 
/B
    Displays the Interlnk server screen in black and white. Use this switch
    if you have problems reading your monochrome monitor.
 
/V
    Prevents conflicts with a computer's timer. Use this switch if you have
    a serial connection between computers and one of them stops running when
    you use Interlnk to access a drive or printer port.
 
/RCOPY
    Copies Interlnk files from one computer to another, provided that the
    computers are connected with a 7-wire, null-modem serial cable and that
    the <MODE> command is available on the computer where you are installing
    Interlnk.

                              INTERSVRฤฤNotes
 
Specifying the order of drives
 
Interlnk redirects drives in the order you specify. The first server drive
specified is redirected to the first available client drive, the second
server drive specified is redirected to the second available client drive,
and so forth.
 
Redirected devices
 
Interlnk does not redirect network drives, CD-ROM drives, or any other
device that uses a redirection interface.
 
Remote copy procedure
 
To copy Interlnk files from one computer to another by using the /RCOPY
switch, you must connect the 7-wire, null-modem serial cable to the
computers' serial ports.
 
Using a serial mouse with Microsoft Windows
 
If you are using a serial mouse with Microsoft Windows and you start the
Interlnk server while Windows is running, you need to specify either the
/LPT switch or a /COM switch that designates a COM port other than the one
the mouse is using. For example, if the serial mouse uses COM1 and you are
using a parallel connection, specify the /LPT switch to prevent Interlnk
from scanning all COM ports.
 
Using Interlnk in a task-switching or multitasking environment
 
If you start the Interlnk server in a task-switching or multitasking
environment, task switching and key combinations that switch you out of your
current task are disabled. To restore these functions, quit the server.
 
Limitations on using INTERSVR with other commands
 
The following commands do not work with the Interlnk server:
 
    CHKDSK         FORMAT
 
    DEFRAG         MIRROR
 
    DISKCOMP       SYS
 
    DISKCOPY       UNDELETE

Suppose you have two computers that each include drives A, B, and C. To
start the Interlnk server and specify that server drive C be redirected to
client drive D, server drive A be redirected to client drive E, and server
drive B be redirected to client drive F, type the following command:
 
    intersvr c: a: b:
 
To specify that all server drives except drive A be redirected and that LPT2
be used to connect to the client, type the following command:
 
    intersvr /x=a: /lpt2

Starts the Keyb program, which configures a keyboard for a specific
language.
 
Use Keyb to configure a keyboard for a language other than United States
English. For an introduction to the Keyb program, see the chapter
"Customizing for International Use" in the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
Syntax
 
At the command prompt, use the following syntax:
 
    KEYB [xx[,[yyy][,[drive:][path]filename]]] [/E] [/ID:nnn]
 
In your CONFIG.SYS file, use the following syntax:
 
    INSTALL=[[dos-drive:]dos-path]KEYB.COM
    [xx[,[yyy][,[drive:][path]filename]]] [/E] [/ID:nnn]
 
Parameters
 
xx
    Specifies the code for a keyboard layout. See the table at the end of
    this topic for a list of valid values for this parameter.
 
yyy
    Specifies the character set (code page). See the table at the end of
    this topic for a list of valid values for this parameter. If this value
    is not specified, KEYB uses the current character set.
 
[drive:][path]filename
    Specifies the location and name of the keyboard definition file. The
    default filename is KEYBOARD.SYS. If KEYBOARD.SYS is in a directory
    included in the path, you do not have to specify these parameters.
    (MS-DOS 6.2 includes two keyboard definition files: KEYBOARD.SYS, the
    default file, and KEYBRD2.SYS, which provides support for keyboards not
    included in KEYBOARD.SYS. For information about using KEYBRD2.SYS, see
    the README.TXT file.)
 
[dos-drive:]dos-path
    Specifies the location of the KEYB.COM file.
 
Switches
 
/E
    Specifies that an enhanced keyboard is installed. Use this switch if you
    are using an enhanced keyboard with an 8086 computer.
 
/ID:nnn
    Specifies the keyboard in use. This switch is valid only for countries
    that have more than one keyboard layout for the same language (France,
    Italy, and the United Kingdom). See the following table for a list of
    valid values for nnn.
 
Values for xx, yyy, and nnn

                                KEYBฤฤNotes
 
Installing character sets
 
The character set you specify for yyy must be installed on your system. If
it isn't, any characters not in the current character set will not be
usable.
 
For information about installing a character set, see the chapter
"Customizing for International Use" in the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
Displaying the current keyboard layout and character set
 
If you use the KEYB command with no parameters or switches, MS-DOS lists the
current keyboard layout (keyboard code), the current keyboard's related
character set (code page), and the current character set (code page) used by
your keyboard and monitor. The information is displayed in the following
format:
 
    Current keyboard code: FR code page: 437
    Current CON code page: 437
 
Switching between Keyb settings
 
To switch from the current Keyb keyboard configuration to the default
keyboard configuration, press CTRL+ALT+F1. To return to the memory-resident
keyboard configuration, press CTRL+ALT+F2. To switch to "typewriter mode,"
the standard for some countries, press CTRL+ALT+F7.
 
Implementing Keyb
 
The following list shows the three different ways that you can start the
Keyb program:
 
  Type KEYB at the command prompt.
 
  Include an INSTALL command for KEYB.COM in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
  Include the appropriate KEYB command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
 
Keyb exit codes
 
The following list shows each exit code and gives a brief description of its
meaning:
 
0    Keyboard definition file was loaded successfully.
 
1    Invalid keyboard code, character set, or syntax was used.
 
2    Keyboard definition file is bad or missing.
 
4    An error occurred while communicating with the keyboard or monitor.
 
5    The requested character set has not been prepared.
 
You can use the ERRORLEVEL parameter on the IF command line in a batch
program to process exit codes returned by Keyb. For an example of a batch
program that processes exit codes, see the <CHOICE> command.

                               KEYBฤฤExample
 
To use a German keyboard if your KEYBOARD.SYS file is in the DOS directory
on drive C, you would type the following command:
 
    keyb gr,,c:\dos\keyboard.sys

ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                   LABEL
 
Creates, changes, or deletes the volume label (name) of a disk.
 
MS-DOS displays the volume label as part of the directory listing. If a
volume serial number exists, MS-DOS displays this number as well.
 
Syntax
 
    LABEL [drive:][label]
 
To specify that MS-DOS is to display the current volume label and serial
number, if they exist, and that MS-DOS is to prompt you to enter a label or
delete the existing one, use the following syntax:
 
    LABEL
 
Parameters
 
drive:
    Specifies the location of the disk you want to name.
 
label
    Specifies the new volume label. You must include a colon (:) between
    drive and label.
 
Related Commands
 
For information about displaying the current disk label, see the <DIR> or
<VOL> command.
 
For information about the volume serial number of a disk, see the <VOL>
command.

                                LABELฤฤNotes
 
LABEL command messages
 
If you do not specify a label when you use the LABEL command, MS-DOS
displays a message in the following format:
 
    Volume in drive A is xxxxxxxxxxx
    Volume Serial Number is xxxx-xxxx
    Volume label (11 characters, ENTER for none)?
 
The "Volume Serial Number" part of the message is not displayed if the disk
has no serial number.
 
You can type the volume label you want or press ENTER to delete the current
label. If a disk has a label and you press ENTER for none, MS-DOS prompts
you with the following message:
 
    Delete current volume label (Y/N)?
 
Press Y to delete the label; press N to keep the label.
 
Limitations on volume label names
 
A volume label can contain as many as 11 characters and can include spaces
but no tabs. Consecutive spaces may be interpreted as a single space.
 
Do not use any of the following characters in a volume label:
 
    * ? / \ | . , ; : + =   [ ] ( ) & ^ < > "
 
MS-DOS displays volume labels in uppercase letters. If you enter a volume
label in lower-case letters, the LABEL command converts the letters to
uppercase.
 
Using LABEL with a redirected drive
 
LABEL does not work on a drive created with the SUBST command.

                               LABELฤฤExample
 
To label a disk in drive A that contains sales information for 1991, you
might type the following:
 
    label a:sales1991

                                 LASTDRIVE
 
Specifies the maximum number of drives you can access. You can use this
command only in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
The value you specify represents the last valid drive MS-DOS is to
recognize.
 
Syntax
 
    LASTDRIVE=x
 
Parameter
 
x
    Specifies a drive letter in the range A through Z.

ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                              LASTDRIVEฤฤNotes
 
Default setting
 
If you do not use the LASTDRIVE command, the default value is the letter
following the last one in use. For example, if you are using drives A and C,
the default value is D.
 
Effect on memory
 
MS-DOS allocates a data structure in memory for each drive specified by
LASTDRIVE, so you should not specify more drives than are necessary.

                                  LOADFIX
 
Ensures that a program is loaded above the first 64K of conventional memory,
and runs the program.
 
Syntax
 
    LOADFIX [drive:][path]filename [program-parameters]
 
Parameters
 
[drive:][path]
    Specifies the drive and directory of the program.
 
filename
    Specifies the name of the program.
 
program-parameters
    Specifies any of the program's parameters that you want to use.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                               LOADFIXฤฤNote
 
Some programs will display the "Packed file corrupt" message when all or a
portion of the program has been loaded in the first 64K of conventional
memory and cannot run successfully. This error is most likely to occur when
you load device drivers into the upper memory area, thereby freeing more of
the first 64K of conventional memory. If MS-DOS displays this message, use
the LOADFIX command to ensure that a program is loaded above the first 64K
of conventional memory.
 
To use the LOADFIX command, include it at the beginning of the command that
starts the program.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                              LOADFIXฤฤExample
 
To load a program named MYAPP.EXE (in the APPS directory of drive C) and use
the /C parameter (for example, to load the program in character mode), type
the following at the command prompt or include the command in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
 
    loadfix c:\apps\myapp.exe /c
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                               LOADHIGH (LH)
 
Loads a program into the upper memory area. Loading a program into the upper
memory area leaves more room in conventional memory for other programs. (For
more information about optimizing memory, see the chapter "Making More
Memory Available" in the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.)
 
Syntax
 
    LOADHIGH [drive:][path]filename [parameters]
 
To specify the region(s) of memory into which to load the program, use the
following syntax:
 
    LOADHIGH [/L:region1[,minsize1][;region2[,minsize2]...] [/S]]
    [drive:][path]filename [parameters]
 
You can abbreviate LOADHIGH as LH.
 
Switches
 
/L:region1[,minsize1][;region2[,minsize2]...]
    Specifies one or more regions of memory into which to load the program.
    If /L is not used, MS-DOS loads the program into the largest free
    upper-memory block (UMB) and makes all other UMBs available for the
    program's use. You can use the /L switch to load the program into a
    specific region of memory or to specify which region(s) the program can
    use.
 
    To load the program into the largest block in a specific region of upper
    memory, specify the region number after the /L switch. For example, to
    load the program into the largest free block in region 4, you would type
    /L:4. (To list the free areas of memory, type MEM /F at the command
    prompt.)
 
    When loaded with the /L switch, a program can use only the specified
    memory region. Some programs use more than one area of memory; for those
    programs, you can specify more than one region. (To find out how a
    particular program uses memory, use the MEM /M command and specify the
    program name as an argument.) To specify two or more regions, separate
    the block numbers with a semicolon (;). For example, to use blocks 2 and
    3, you would type /L:2;3.
 
    Normally, MS-DOS loads the program into a UMB in the specified region
    only if that region contains a UMB larger than the program's load size
    (usually equal to the size of the executable program file). If the
    program requires more memory while running than it does when loaded, you
    can use the minsize parameter to ensure that the program will not be
    loaded into a UMB that is too small for it. If you specify a value for
    minsize, MS-DOS loads the program into that region only if it contains a
    UMB that is larger than both the program's load size and the minsize
    value.
 
/S
    Shrinks the UMB to its minimum size while the program is loading. Using
    this switch makes the most efficient use of memory. This switch is
    typically used only by the MemMaker program, which can analyze a
    program's memory use to determine whether the /S switch can safely be
    used when loading that program. This switch can be used only in
    conjunction with the /L switch and affects only UMBs for which a minimum
    size was specified.
 
Parameters
 
[drive:][path]filename
    Specifies the location and name of the program you want to load.
 
parameters
    Specifies any command-line information required by the program.

                            LOADHIGH (LH)ฤฤNotes
 
DOS=UMB command required
 
To use the LOADHIGH command, you must include the DOS=UMB command in your
CONFIG.SYS file. For more information about the DOS=UMB command, see the
<DOS> command.
 
Using MemMaker to optimize the upper memory area automatically
 
The MemMaker program, included with MS-DOS 6, automatically optimizes your
system's memory. MemMaker surveys the upper memory area, analyzes the memory
use of your drivers and programs, and determines which drivers and programs
fit best into the available UMBs. MemMaker then adds the LOADHIGH command to
selected lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and adds /L and /S switches as
necessary. For more information about using MemMaker to optimize your
computer's memory, see the chapter "Making More Memory Available" in the
MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
Upper-memory-area manager must be installed
 
Before you can load a program into the upper memory area, you must install
an upper-memory-area manager. MS-DOS provides EMM386.EXE, which manages the
upper memory area for computers with an 80386 or higher processor. To
install EMM386, you add a DEVICE command to your CONFIG.SYS file. (The
DEVICE command for the HIMEM.SYS extended-memory manager must precede the
DEVICE command for EMM386.)
 
How LOADHIGH works
 
When you use the LOADHIGH command to load a program, MS-DOS attempts to load
it into the upper memory area. If there is insufficient space in the upper
memory area, MS-DOS loads the program into conventional memory. To determine
which UMB(s) the program is using, use the MEM /M command and specify the
program name as an argument.
 
Using LOADHIGH in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
 
The most convenient way to use the LOADHIGH command is to include it in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. (If you use the MemMaker program, it automatically adds
any necessary LOADHIGH commands to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.)
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                          LOADHIGH (LH)ฤฤExamples
 
The following command loads the DOSKEY program into the upper memory area
and specifies that MS-DOS should load the driver into region 1:
 
    loadhigh /l:1 c:\dos\doskey
 
The following command loads the MYPROG.EXE program into region 1, and also
gives it access to upper memory regions 3 and 4:
 
    lh /L:1;3;4 c:\programs\myprog.exe
 
The following command loads the MYPROG program into conventional memory
(region 0) and also gives it access to upper memory region 1:
 
    loadhigh /l:0;1 c:\programs\myprog.exe

                                    MEM
 
Displays the amount of used and free memory on your computer.
 
You can use the MEM command to display information about allocated memory
areas, free memory areas, and programs that are currently loaded into
memory.
 
Syntax
 
    MEM [/CLASSIFY|/DEBUG|/FREE|/MODULE modulename] [/PAGE]
 
To display the status of your computer's used and free memory, use the
following syntax:
 
    MEM
 
Switches
 
/CLASSIFY
    Lists the programs that are currently loaded into memory and shows how
    much conventional and upper memory each program is using. MEM /CLASSIFY
    also summarizes overall memory use and lists the largest free memory
    blocks. You can use the /CLASSIFY switch with /PAGE but not with other
    MEM switches. You can abbreviate /CLASSIFY as /C.
 
/DEBUG
    Lists the programs and internal drivers that are currently loaded into
    memory. MEM /DEBUG shows each module's size, segment address, and module
    type, summarizes overall memory use, and displays other information
    useful for programming. You can use the /DEBUG switch with /PAGE but not
    with other MEM switches. You can abbreviate /DEBUG as /D.
 
/FREE
    Lists the free areas of conventional and upper memory. MEM /FREE shows
    the segment address and size of each free area of conventional memory,
    and shows the largest free upper memory block in each region of upper
    memory. You can use the /FREE switch with /PAGE but not with other MEM
    switches. You can abbreviate /FREE as /F.
 
/MODULE programname
    Shows how a program module is currently using memory. You must specify
    the program name after the /MODULE switch. MEM /MODULE lists the areas
    of memory the specified program module has allocated and shows the
    address and size of each area. You can use the /MODULE switch with
    /PAGE, but not with other MEM switches. You can abbreviate /MODULE as
    /M.
 
/PAGE
    Pauses after each screen of output. This switch can be used with any of
    the other MEM switches.

Specifying the /PAGE switch automatically
 
You can use the DOSKEY program to automatically add the /PAGE switch to the
MEM command. Then, each time you use MEM, it will pause after each screenful
of information even if you don't type the /P switch on the MEM command line.
To do this, add the following commands to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
 
    c:\dos\doskey
    doskey mem=mem.exe $* /p
 
Displaying memory status
 
MS-DOS displays the status of extended memory only if you have installed
memory above the 1-megabyte (MB) boundary in your system. MS-DOS displays
the status of expanded memory only if you use expanded memory that conforms
to version 4.0 of the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded Memory Specification
(LIM EMS). MS-DOS displays the status of the upper memory area only if a UMB
provider such as EMM386 is installed and the command DOS=UMB is included in
the CONFIG.SYS file. MS-DOS does not display the status of the upper memory
area if you issue the MEM command while you are running Windows version
3.0.
 
Allocating extended memory
 
To allocate Interrupt 15h memory and XMS memory at the same time, use the
/INT15 switch when you load the HIMEM.SYS device driver.
 
For more information, see <HIMEM.SYS>.

"Reserved" is the memory located on add-on boards such as video adapter
boards. "Largest executable program size" is the largest contiguous block of
conventional memory available for a program. "Largest free upper memory
block" is the largest area of upper memory available for a program. "MS-DOS
is resident in the high memory area" indicates that MS-DOS is running in the
first 64K of extended memory rather than in conventional memory.
 
Getting information about a specific program
 
To find out what memory a specific program module has allocated, use the MEM
/MODULE command. For example, to find out what memory the WIN386 module has
allocated, you would type the following command:
 
    mem /module win386
 
If you were running WIN386, the results might look similar to the
following:
 
WIN386 is using the following memory:
 
  Segment  Region       Total        Type
  ฤฤฤฤฤฤ-  ฤฤฤฤฤฤ  ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ  ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

                   ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ
  Total Size: 98,336   (96K)
 
Some program modules, such as WIN386, allocate more than one area of memory.
The MEM /MODULE command displays all the areas of memory allocated by the
specified program, and shows the segment address and size of each
allocation. For upper memory blocks, MEM /MODULE also shows the region
number. The Type column shows how the program is using that particular area
of memory. The "total size," in this case 98,336 bytes (96K), shows the
total amount of memory allocated by MS-DOS for the specified program.

                                  MEMMAKER
 
Starts the MemMaker program, which optimizes your computer's memory by
moving device drivers and memory-resident programs to upper memory. To use
MemMaker, your computer must have an 80386 or 80486 processor and extended
memory. For more information about running MemMaker, see the chapter "Making
More Memory Available" in the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
Do not use this command while Windows is running.
 
Syntax
 
    MEMMAKER [/B] [/BATCH] [/SESSION] [/SWAP:drive] [/T] [/UNDO] [/W:n,m]
 
Switches
 
/B
    Displays MemMaker in black and white. Use this option if MemMaker isn't
    displayed correctly on a monochrome monitor.
 
/BATCH
    Runs MemMaker in batch (unattended) mode. In batch mode, MemMaker takes
    the default action at all prompts. If an error occurs, MemMaker restores
    your previous CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT and (if necessary) Windows
    SYSTEM.INI files. After MemMaker has completed, you can review status
    messages by viewing the contents of the MEMMAKER.STS file. (To view this
    file, use a text editor such as MS-DOS Editor, or use the TYPE
    command.)
 
/SESSION
    Used exclusively by MemMaker during the optimization process.
 
/SWAP:drive
    Specifies the letter of the drive that was originally your startup disk
    drive. Specify the current drive letter after the colon. This switch is
    necessary only if the drive letter of your startup disk drive has
    changed since your computer started. (The drive letter sometimes changes
    because of disk swapping performed by some disk-compression programs.)
    If the drive letter of your startup drive has changed and you do not
    specify this switch, MemMaker will be unable to find your system startup
    files.
 
    You do not need to use this switch if you are using Stacker 2.0,
    SuperStor, or Microsoft DoubleSpace.
 
/T
    Disables the detection of IBM Token-Ring networks. Use this switch if
    your computer includes such a network and you are having problems
    running MemMaker.
 
/UNDO
    Instructs MemMaker to undo its most recent changes. When MemMaker
    optimizes your system's memory, it makes changes to your CONFIG.SYS and
    AUTOEXEC.BAT files (and, if necessary, your Windows SYSTEM.INI file). If
    your system doesn't work properly after MemMaker completes, or if you
    are not satisfied with your new memory configuration, you can return to
    your previous configuration by starting MemMaker with the /UNDO switch.
 
/W:size1,size2
    Specifies how much upper-memory space to reserve for Windows translation
    buffers. Windows needs two areas of upper memory for its translation
    buffers. The size1 value specifies the size of the first region; size2
    specifies the size of the second region. By default, MemMaker does not
    reserve upper memory for Windows; this is equivalent to specifying
    /W:0,0.

                             MEMMAKERฤฤExamples
 
To run MemMaker in batch mode and to direct it not to reserve any upper
memory for Windows translation buffers, use the following command:
 
    memmaker /batch /w:0,0
 
To have MemMaker restore your previous system configuration, use the
following command:
 
    memmaker /undo
 
Suppose you use a disk-compression program. Your startup disk is drive C,
but after the compression driver starts, drive C becomes your main
compressed drive. Your startup files are now on drive D. Because of this
drive-letter swapping, you would start MemMaker by using the following
command:
 
    memmaker /swap:d
 
This command specifies that the current drive D was originally the startup
drive and contains your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
 
Note:  You do not need to use the /SWAP switch if you are using Microsoft
       DoubleSpace disk compression or the Stacker 2.0 disk-compression
       program.

                                 MENUCOLOR
 
Sets the text and background colors for the startup menu. You can use this
command only within a menu block in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
The startup menu is a list of choices that appears when you start your
computer. You define a startup menu by using special CONFIG.SYS commands.
Each item on the menu corresponds to a set of CONFIG.SYS commands called a
"configuration block." A startup menu makes it possible to start your
computer with a variety of configurations. For more information about
defining multiple configurations, see the chapter "Configuring Your System"
in the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
Syntax
 
    MENUCOLOR=x[,y]
 
Parameters
 
x
    Specifies the color of the menu text. You can specify a value from 0 to
    15; For a list of values and colors, see "Color Values" later in this
    topic.
 
y
    Specifies the color of the screen background. You can specify a value
    from 0 to 15; For a list of values and colors, see "Color Values" later
    in this topic. The y value is optional; if you do not specify a value,
    MS-DOS displays the specified text color on a black background.
 
Be sure to specify different values for x and y, or the text will not be
readable.
 
Color Values
 
Valid color values are from 0 to 15, as follows:
 
    0  Black             8  Gray
    1  Blue              9  Bright blue
    2  Green            10  Bright green
    3  Cyan             11  Bright cyan
    4  Red              12  Bright red
    5  Magenta          13  Bright magenta
    6  Brown            14  Yellow
    7  White            15  Bright white
 
Note: On some displays, colors 8 through 15 blink.

                                MENUDEFAULT
 
Specifies the default menu item on the startup menu and sets a timeout value
if desired. You can use this command only within a menu block in your
CONFIG.SYS file. If you do not use this command, MS-DOS sets the default to
item 1.
 
The startup menu is a list of choices that appears when you start your
computer. You define a startup menu by using special CONFIG.SYS commands.
Each item on the menu corresponds to a set of CONFIG.SYS commands called a
"configuration block." A startup menu makes it possible to start your
computer with a variety of configurations. For more information about
defining multiple configurations, see the chapter "Configuring Your System"
in the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
Syntax
 
    MENUDEFAULT=blockname[,timeout]
 
Parameters
 
blockname
    Specifies the default menu item by its associated configuration block.
    The block must be defined elsewhere in the CONFIG.SYS file. When MS-DOS
    displays the startup menu, the default menu item is highlighted and its
    number appears after the "Enter a choice" prompt.
 
timeout
    Determines how many seconds MS-DOS waits before starting the computer
    with the default configuration. If you don't specify a timeout value,
    MS-DOS does not continue until the ENTER key is pressed. You can specify
    a timeout value from 0 to 90 seconds. A timeout of 0 forces automatic
    selection of the default, effectively bypassing the menu display.

                            MENUDEFAULTฤฤExample
 
The following menu block defines three menu items, sets the default item to
"full_config," and sets the timeout to 30 seconds:
 
    [menu]
    menuitem=base_config,Base configuration only
    menuitem=full_config,Normal configuration
    menuitem=network,Normal configuration with network
    menudefault=full_config,30
 
When MS-DOS starts and reads this menu block, it displays the following
menu:
 
    MS-DOS 6 Startup Menu
    =====================
 
       1. Base configuration only
       2. Normal configuration
       3. Normal configuration with network
 
    Enter a choice: 2                       Time remaining: 30
 
After displaying this menu, MS-DOS waits 30 seconds; if no other item is
selected, MS-DOS then starts the computer using the commands in the
[full_config] configuration block.

                                  MENUITEM
 
Defines an item on the startup menu. You can use this command only within a
menu block in your CONFIG.SYS file. You can have up to nine menu items per
menu.
 
The startup menu is a list of choices that appears when you start your
computer. You define a startup menu by using special CONFIG.SYS commands.
Each item on the menu corresponds to a set of CONFIG.SYS commands called a
"configuration block." A startup menu makes it possible to start your
computer with a variety of configurations. For more information about
defining multiple configurations, see the chapter "Configuring Your System"
in the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
Syntax
 
    MENUITEM=blockname[,menu_text]
 
Parameters
 
blockname
    Specifies the name of the associated configuration block. The block must
    be defined elsewhere in the CONFIG.SYS file. If the menu item is
    selected from the startup menu, MS-DOS carries out the commands in the
    associated configuration block, as well as any commands at the beginning
    of the CONFIG.SYS file and any commands in configuration blocks with the
    [common] header.
 
    If MS-DOS cannot find a block with the specified name, the item does not
    appear on the startup menu. The block name can be up to 70 characters
    long and can contain most printable characters. It cannot include
    spaces, backslashes (\), forward slashes (/), commas, semicolons (;),
    equal signs (=), or square brackets ([ and ]).
 
menu_text
    Specifies the text you want MS-DOS to display for this menu item. If you
    don't specify any menu text, MS-DOS displays the block name as the menu
    item. The menu text can be up to 70 characters long and can contain any
    characters you want.
 
Related Commands
 
The MENUITEM command is one of six special CONFIG.SYS commands for defining

                              MENUITEMฤฤNotes
 
Defining menu blocks
 
A menu block is a set of menu-definition commands that begins with a block
headerฤฤthe name of the block enclosed in square brackets. To have a startup
menu, your CONFIG.SYS file must contain a menu block that has the [menu]
block header.
 
You can use the <SUBMENU> command to define submenus. Each submenu has its
own menu block, which can be named anything you want.
 
A menu block must contain at least one MENUITEM or SUBMENU command.
 
Number of items on the startup menu
 
MS-DOS displays the menu items in the order they appear in the menu block
and numbers them automatically. The first menu item is always number 1 on

                             MENUITEMฤฤExamples
 
The following [menu] block defines a startup menu with two items, Apples and
Oranges:
 
    [menu]
    menuitem=Apples
    menuitem=Oranges
 
When MS-DOS starts, the menu will appear as follows:
 
    MS-DOS 6 Startup Menu
    =====================
 
       1. Apples
       2. Oranges
 
    Enter a choice: 1
 
The following [MENU] block defines a startup menu with three items and
specifies menu text for each item:
 
    [menu]
    menuitem=base_config,Base configuration only
    menuitem=full_config,Normal configuration
    menuitem=net_config,Normal configuration with network
 
In this example, the first item corresponds to the [base_config]
configuration block, the second to the [full_config] block, and the third to
the [net_config] block. When MS-DOS starts, it displays the following menu:
 
    MS-DOS 6 Startup Menu
    =====================
 
       1. Base configuration only
       2. Normal configuration
       3. Normal configuration with network

Suppose you want to create a directory on the disk in the current drive and
use the directory to store all your tax information. To create a directory
named TAXES, type the following command:
 
    mkdir \taxes
 
You could also type this command with the same results:
 
    md \taxes
 
Now suppose that the TAXES directory is the current directory and that you
want to create a subdirectory of TAXES named PROPERTY. To create the
PROPERTY directory, type the following command:
 
    mkdir property

                                    MODE
 
Configures system devices. The MODE command performs many different tasks,
such as displaying system status, changing system settings, or reconfiguring
ports or devices.
 
Using the MODE command
 
Because the MODE command can perform many different tasks, the syntax
necessary to carry out each task is different. The following is a list of
tasks for which you can use the MODE command.
 
  Reconfiguring a printer attached to a parallel port (LPT1, LPT2, or LPT3)
   for printing at 80 or 132 characters per line, 6 or 8 lines per inch, or
   both (if the printer supports these features). For more information, see
   <MODE (configure printer)>.
 
  Configuring the baud rate, parity, and number of data bits and stop bits
   of a serial port (COM1, COM2, COM3, and COM4) for use with a specific
   printer, modem, or other serial device. For more information, see
   <MODE (configure serial port)>.
 
  Displaying the status of all devices or of a single device. For more
   information, see <MODE (display device status)>.
 
  Redirecting printer output from a parallel port to a serial port so that
   the serial port becomes the system's default printer port. For more
   information, see <MODE (redirect printing)>.
 
  Preparing devices for character set (code page) switching. For more
   information, see <MODE (set device code pages)>.
 
  Selecting another display adapter or changing the configuration of the
   current display adapter. For more information, see
   <MODE (set display mode)>.
 
  Setting the keyboard's typematic rate. For more information, see
   <MODE (set typematic rate)>.
 
Requirement for ANSI.SYS and DISPLAY.SYS
 
MODE can perform some tasks, such as setting the display mode, only if you
have included a DEVICE command for the ANSI.SYS device driver in your
CONFIG.SYS file. You must install DISPLAY.SYS to use MODE (set device code
pages) for character-set switching.
 
Adding mode commands to AUTOEXEC.BAT
 
Although you can type each form of the MODE command at the command prompt,
you can also use MODE commands within your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to reconfigure
your system automatically each time you turn on or restart your computer.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                          MODE (Configure Printer)
 
Configures a printer connected to a parallel printer port.
 
This version of the MODE command sets the characteristics for an
IBM-compatible or Epson-compatible printer connected to a parallel printer
port (LPT1, LPT2, or LPT3).
 
Syntax
 
    MODE LPTn[:] [c][,[l][,r]]
 
    MODE LPTn[:] [COLS=c] [LINES=l] [RETRY=r]
 
Parameters
 
LPTn
    Specifies the parallel port to which the device is attached. Valid
    values for n are in the range 1 through 3.
 
    If you omit any of the following three parameters, MODE uses the most
    recent setting for the omitted parameter. If you are using the shorter
    form of the syntax (without the words COLS=, LINES=, and RETRY=), the
    MODE command "recognizes" the parameters by their positions. Thus, if
    you do not specify a value for a parameter, you must still type the
    comma that precedes the next parameter.
 
COLS=c
    Specifies the number of characters (columns) per line: 80 or 132. The
    default value is 80. You can abbreviate this parameter by omitting COLS=
    and specifying a value for c.
 
LINES=l
    Specifies the vertical spacing and the number of lines per inch: 6 or 8.
    The default value is 6. You can abbreviate this parameter by omitting
    LINES= and specifying a value for l.
 
RETRY=r
    Specifies the retry action to take if a time-out error occurs when MODE
    attempts to send output to a parallel printer. This parameter causes
    part of MODE to remain resident in memory. The following list shows each
    valid value for r and a brief description of its meaning:
 
    B    Return "busy" from a status check of a busy port.
 
    E    Return an error from a status check of a busy port.
 
    P    Continue retrying until printer accepts output.
 
    R    Return "ready" from a status check of a busy port.
 
    N    Take no retry action (default value). You can also specify NONE
         for this value.
 
If you are using the MODE command over a network, do not use any of the r
values.
 
You can abbreviate this parameter by omitting RETRY= and specifying a value
for r.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                      MODE (Configure Printer)ฤฤNotes
 
Update to MODE parameter
 
The RETRY=R setting provides the same support as the P parameter did in
previous versions of MS-DOS.
 
Breaking out of a time-out loop
 
To break out of a time-out loop, press CTRL+BREAK.

                     MODE (Configure Printer)ฤฤExamples
 
Suppose you want to be able to print 80 characters per line and 8 lines per
inch on a parallel printer that is connected to the second parallel printer
port (LPT2). To do this, type the following command:
 
    mode lpt2:80,8
 
Because 80 characters per line is the default setting, you could achieve the
same result by typing the following command:
 
    mode lpt2:,8
 
Suppose that, when printing a file, you want your system to keep trying to
print the file until it is successful. To do this, type the following
command:
 
    mode lpt2:,8,b
 
To stop your system from continually retrying to print, press CTRL+BREAK or
type the MODE command without specifying a value for r.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                        MODE (Configure Serial Port)
 
Configures a serial communications port.
 
This version of the MODE command sets the parameters for a serial port
(COM1, COM2, COM3, or COM4).
 
Syntax
 
    MODE COMm[:] [b[,p[,d[,s[,r]]]]]
 
    MODE COMm[:] [BAUD=b] [PARITY=p] [DATA=d] [STOP=s] [RETRY=r]
 
Parameters
 
COMm
    Specifies the number of the serial (COM) port. Valid values for m are in
    the range 1 through 4.
 
    If you omit any of the following five parameters, MODE uses the most
    recent setting for the omitted parameter. If you are using the shorter
    form of the syntax (without the words BAUD=, PARITY=, DATA=, and so on),
    the MODE command "recognizes" the parameters by their positions. Thus,
    if you do not specify a value for a parameter, you must still type the
    comma that precedes the next parameter.
 
BAUD=b
    Specifies the first two digits of the transmission rate in bits per
    second. The following list shows each valid value for b and its related
    rate:
 
    11    110 baud
 
    15    150 baud
 
    30    300 baud
 
    60    600 baud
 
    12    1200 baud
 
    24    2400 baud
 
    48    4800 baud
 
    96    9600 baud
 
    19    19,200 baud
 
    The b value of 19 is not supported on all computers (check your hardware
    manual). You can abbreviate this parameter by omitting BAUD= and
    specifying a value for b.
 
PARITY=p
    Specifies how the system uses the parity bit to check for transmission
    errors. The p value can be one of the following: N (none), E (even), O
    (odd), M (mark), or S (space). The default value is E. Not all computers
    support the values M and S. You can abbreviate this parameter by
    omitting PARITY= and specifying a value for p.
 
DATA=d
    Specifies the number of data bits in a character. Valid values for d are
    in the range 5 through 8. The default value is 7. Not all computers
    support the values 5 and 6. You can abbreviate this parameter by
    omitting DATA= and specifying a value for d.
 
STOP=s
    Specifies the number of stop bits that define the end of a character: 1,
    1.5, or 2. If the baud rate is 110, the default value is 2; otherwise,
    the default value is 1. Not all computers support the value 1.5. You can
    abbreviate this parameter by omitting STOP= and specifying a value for
    s.
 
RETRY=r
    Specifies the retry action to take if a time-out error occurs when MODE
    attempts to send output to a serial printer. This parameter causes part
    of MODE to remain resident in memory. The following list shows each
    valid value for r and a brief description of its meaning:
 
    E    Return an error from a status check of a busy port.
 
    B    Return "busy" from a status check of a busy port.
 
    P    Continue retrying until printer accepts output.
 
    R    Return "ready" from a status check of a busy port.
 
    N    Take no retry action (default value). You can also specify none for
    this value.
 
    If you are using the MODE command over a network, do not use any of the
    r values. You can abbreviate this parameter by simply omitting RETRY=
    and specifying a value for r.

                        MODE (Display Device Status)
 
Displays the status of one or all of the devices installed on your system.
 
Syntax
 
    MODE [device] [/STATUS]
 
To display the status of all devices installed on your system, use the
following syntax:
 
    MODE
 
Parameter
 
device
    Specifies the name of the device for which you want to display the
    status.
 
Switch
 
/STATUS
    Requests the status of any redirected parallel printers. The MODE
    command, when used without this switch, displays the status of all
    installed devices except redirected parallel printers. You can
    abbreviate the /STATUS switch as /STA.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                   MODE (Display Device Status)ฤฤExample
 
To display the status of the monitor and keyboard, type the following
command:
 
    mode con /status
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                          MODE (Redirect Printing)
 
Redirects output from a parallel port to a serial communications port.
 
Syntax
 
    MODE LPTn[:]=COMm[:]
 
Parameters
 
LPTn
    Specifies the parallel port. Valid values for n are in the range 1
    through 3.
 
COMm
    Specifies the serial port. Valid values for m are in the range 1 through
    4.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                     MODE (Redirect Printing)ฤฤExamples
 
Suppose you want to set up your system so that it sends parallel-printer
output to a serial printer. To do this, you must use the MODE command twice.
The first time, you use MODE to configure the serial port; the second time,
you use MODE to redirect parallel-printer output to the serial port you
specified in the first MODE command.
 
For example, if your serial printer operates at 4800 baud with even parity
and is connected to the COM1 port (the first serial connection on your
computer), you would type the following two commands:
 
    mode com1 48,e,,,b
 
    mode lpt1=com1
 
If you redirect parallel-printer output from LPT1 to COM1 but then decide
that you want to print a file by using LPT1, use the following command
before you print the file. This command prevents MS-DOS from redirecting the
file from LPT1 to COM1.
 
    mode lpt1

                        MODE (Set Device Code Pages)
 
Prepares, selects, refreshes, or displays the numbers of the character sets
(code pages) for parallel printers or the keyboard and monitor. For an
introduction to using character sets, see "Customizing for International
Use" in the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
Syntax
 
    MODE device CODEPAGE PREPARE=((yyy [...]) [drive:][path]filename)
 
    MODE device CODEPAGE SELECT=yyy
 
    MODE device CODEPAGE REFRESH
 
    MODE device CODEPAGE [/STATUS]
 
Parameters
 
device
    Specifies the device for which you want to prepare or select a character
    set. Valid names for device are CON, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, and PRN.
 
CODEPAGE PREPARE
    Prepares character sets for the specified device. You must prepare a
    character set for a device before you can use the character set with
    that device. After you use the CODEPAGE PREPARE form of the MODE
    command, use the CODEPAGE SELECT form of MODE to specify the character
    set you want to use. You can abbreviate CODEPAGE as CP and PREPARE as
    PREP.
 
yyy
    Specifies the number of the character set to prepare or select. The
    following list shows each character set supported by the EGA.CPI file
    and its country or language:
 
    437    United States
 
    850    Multilingual (Latin I)
 
    852    Slavic (Latin II)
 
    860    Portuguese
 
    863    Canadian-French
 
    865    Nordic

    information about EGA2.CPI, see the README.TXT file.
 
[drive:][path]filename
    Specifies the location and name of the code-page-information (.CPI) file
    that MS-DOS uses to prepare a character set for the specified device.
 
CODEPAGE SELECT
    Specifies (selects) which character set to use with the specified
    device. Before selecting a character set, you must use the CODEPAGE
    PREPARE form of the MODE command to prepare a character set. You can
    abbreviate CODEPAGE as CP and SELECT as SEL.
 
CODEPAGE REFRESH
    Reinstates the prepared character sets if they are lost as the result of
    a hardware problem or other error. You can abbreviate CODEPAGE as CP and
    REFRESH as REF.
 
CODEPAGE
    Displays the numbers of the character sets, if any, that are prepared or
    selected for the specified device.
 
Switch
 
/STATUS
    Displays the numbers of the current character sets prepared or selected
    for the specified device. You can abbreviate this switch as /STA.
    Whether or not you specify the /STATUS switch, typing the MODE command
    with a device name and the CODEPAGE parameter displays the numbers of
    the character sets that are prepared or selected for the specified
    device.

                         MODE (Set Typematic Rate)
 
Sets the keyboard typematic rate, the rate at which MS-DOS repeats a
character when you hold down the key for that character.
 
The typematic rate has two components, the rate and the delay. Some
keyboards do not recognize this command.
 
Syntax
 
    MODE CON[:] [RATE=r DELAY=d]
 
Parameters
 
CON[:]
    Refers to the keyboard.
 
RATE=r
    Specifies the rate at which a character is repeated on the screen when
    you hold down a key. Valid values are in the range 1 through 32. These
    values are equal to approximately 2 to 30 characters per second,
    respectively. The default value is 20 for IBM AT-compatible keyboards
    and 21 for IBM PS/2-compatible keyboards. If you set the rate, you must
    also set the delay. for IBM PS/2-compatible keyboards. If you set the
    rate, you must also set the delay.
 
DELAY=d
    Specifies the amount of time that must elapseฤฤafter you press and hold
    down a keyฤฤbefore MS-DOS starts to repeat the character. Valid values
    for d are 1, 2, 3, and 4 (representing 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1 second,
    respectively). The default value is 2. If you set the delay, you must

Sources of data
 
When using the redirection character (<), you must specify a filename as the
source. When using the pipe (|), you can use such commands as DIR, SORT, and
TYPE. Before using a pipe for redirection, you should set the TEMP
environment variable in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

                               MOREฤฤExamples
 
Suppose you have a long file named CLIENTS.NEW that you want to view on your
screen. Either of the following two commands redirects the file through the
MORE command to begin displaying the contents of the file:
 
    more < clients.new
 
    type clients.new | more
 
The MORE command displays the first screen of information from CLIENTS.NEW
and then prompts you with the following message:
 
    ฤฤ More ฤฤ
 
You can then press any key to see the next screen of information.

                                    MOVE
 
Moves one or more files to the location you specify. The MOVE command can
also be used to rename directories.
 
Syntax
 
    MOVE [/Y|/-Y] [drive:][path]filename[,[drive:][path]filename[...]]
    destination
 
Parameters
 
[drive:][path]filename
    Specifies the location and name of the file or files you want to move.
    Also specifies the name of a directory you want to rename.
 
destination
    Specifies the new location of the file, or the new name of the
    directory. Destination can consist of a drive letter and colon, a
    directory name, or a combination. If you are moving only one file, you
    can also specify a filename if you want to rename the file when you move
    it. If you are moving more than one file, the destination must be a
    directory name. Moving a file to an existing file overwrites the
    existing file.
 
Switches
 
/Y
    Indicates that you want MOVE to replace existing file(s) without
    prompting you for confirmation. By default, if you specify an existing
    file as the destination file, MOVE will ask you if you want to overwrite
    the existing file. (Previous versions of MS-DOS would simply replace the
    existing file.) If the MOVE command is part of a batch file, MOVE will
    replace the file without prompting you. Specifying this switch overrides
    all defaults and the current setting of the COPYCMD environment
    variable.
 
/-Y
    Indicates that you want MOVE to prompt you for confirmation when
    replacing an existing file. Specifying this switch overrides all
    defaults and the current setting of the COPYCMD environment variable.

                                MOVEฤฤNotes
 
Renaming a file while moving it
 
If you move only one file to a new directory, you can rename the file as you
move it by specifying the new filename in the destination. However, if you
move more than one file to a new directory in the same command line, you
cannot specify a filename as a destination. If you specify a destination
filename and the file already exists, MOVE will overwrite the existing file
without prompting you.
 
If you specify a filename when moving more than one file, you will see the
following message:
 
    Cannot move multiple files to a single file
 
Renaming a directory using the MOVE command
 
You can rename a directory using the MOVE command. Specify the old directory
name as the file you want to move, and then specify the new directory name
as the destination. You can change the directory name, but you cannot move
the directory to another location in the directory tree.
 
For example, to rename a directory called NEW on drive C to OLD, type the
following command:
 
    move c:\new c:\old
 
The following command is invalid because the new directory name is not in
the same location as the old directory name:
 
    move c:\new c:\dos\new
 
When you issue this command, MS-DOS displays the following error message:
 
    c:\new => c:\dos\new [Unable to open source]
 
Setting the COPYCMD environment variable
 
You can set the COPYCMD environment variable to specify whether you want the
COPY, MOVE, and XCOPY commands to prompt you for confirmation before
overwriting a file in all cases, whether issued from the command prompt or a
batch file.
 
To force the COPY, MOVE, and XCOPY commands to prompt you before overwriting
in all cases, set the COPYCMD environment variable /-Y. To force these
commands to overwrite in all cases without prompting you, set the COPYCMD
environment variable to /Y.
 
Typing any of these commands with the /Y or /-Y switch overrides all
defaults and the current setting of the COPYCMD environment variable.
 
Errorlevel parameters
 
If the MOVE command successfully moved the file or files you specified, it
returns an ERRORLEVEL value of 0. If there was an error in moving one or
more of the files you specified, the MOVE command returns an ERRORLEVEL
value of 1.

                                    MSAV
 
Scans your computer for known viruses.
 
Syntax
    MSAV [drive:] [/S | /C] [/R] [/A | /L]
    [/N] [/P] [/F] [/VIDEO]
 
Parameter
 
drive:
    Specifies the drive that MSAV scans for viruses. If you do not specify a
    drive, MSAV scans the current drive.
 
Switches
 
/S
    Scans the specified drive, but does not remove viruses that MSAV finds.
 
/C
    Scans the specified drive, and removes viruses that MSAV finds.
 
/R
    Creates an MSAV.RPT file that lists the number of files MSAV checked for
    viruses, the number of viruses it found, and the number of viruses it
    removed. By default, MSAV does not create a report. When it does create
    MSAV.RPT, the file is placed in the root directory.
 
/A
    Scans all drives except drive A and drive B.
 
/L
    Scans all local drives except network drives.
 
/N
    Displays the contents of an MSAV.TXT file, if it exists and it is
    located in the directory that contains the MSAV.EXE file. MSAV then
    scans the current drive or the drive you specify. MSAV does not use the
    graphical interface. If MSAV detects a virus, it returns exit code 86
    instead of displaying a message on your screen.
 
/P
    Displays a command-line interface instead of the graphical interface.
 
/F
    Turns off the display of filenames that have been scanned. Use this
    switch only with the /N or /P switch.

CHKLIST.MS files
 
Microsoft Anti-Virus creates a CHKLIST.MS file in each directory you scan
for viruses. The first time you scan a directory, Microsoft Anti-Virus
records in the CHKLIST.MS file checksums for each program. During subsequent
scans, it compares new checksums with the originals to determine if program
files have changed. A difference in checksum values indicates a possible
virus infection.
 
Real symptoms versus false alarms
 
Damaged programs, some memory-resident programs, and conflicts among device
drivers can cause your computer to act as if it were infected by a virus
when it is not. If you suspect your computer is infected, consider the
possible causes for the symptoms you observe. Instead of a computer virus, a
hardware or software problem is likely to be producing errors.
 
Check All Files option
 
When the Check All Files option is selected, AnitVirus for MS-DOS checks
only files with the following extensions: .386, .APP, .BIN, .CMD, .DOM,
.DLL, .DRV, .EXE, .FON, .ICO, .OV*, .PGM, .PIF, .PRG, .SYS.
 
MSAV.INI and the MSDOSDATA environment variable
 
When you start Anti-Virus for MS-DOS, it uses an initialization file named
MSAV.INI to configure the program. To determine the location of the MSAV.INI
file, Anti-Virus for MS-DOS first searches for the MSDOSDATA environment
variable, which specifies the path to the initialization file. If this
environment variable is not defined, the program searches for the MSAV.INI
file in the directory from which you started Anti-Virus for MS-DOS. If the
program does not find the file, the program creates it using default values
and places it in the directory.
 
The MSDOSDATA environment variable is useful if you share the MSAV.EXE file
with others, but use your own configuration for Anti-Virus for MS-DOS. For
example, suppose the MSAV.EXE file is located in the root directory on drive
P, a read-execute-only network server, and you want Anti-Virus for MS-DOS to
use your own configuration when it starts. To specify that it use the
MSAV.INI file located in the DOS directory on your drive C instead of the
initialization file located on network drive P, add the following line to
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
 
        set msdosdata=c:\dos
 
To start Anti-Virus for MS-DOS, type the following at the command prompt:
 
        p:\msav
 
Changes you make to the configuration of Anti-Virus for MS-DOS are saved in
the MSAV.INI file located in the DOS directory on drive C.
 
Using the /N switch
 
If you specify the /N switch, MSAV displays the contents of an MSAV.TXT
file, if it exists and it is located in the directory that contains the
MSAV.EXE file. MSAV then scans the current drive or the drive you specify.
MSAV does not use the graphical interface. If MSAV detects a virus, it
returns exit code 86 instead of displaying a message on your screen.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                               MSAVฤฤExamples
 
To start MSAV using a black and white color scheme, and to specify that MSAV
check all drives except drives A and B, type the following command:
 
    msav /bw /a
 
To write a simple batch program named VIRUS that supports the MSAV exit code
and the /S switch to scan the current drive, you can type the following
commands by using MS-DOS Editor:
 
    echo off
    rem Smith's msav command
    msav /s /n
    if errorlevel 86 goto virus
    if not errorlevel 86 goto none
    :virus
    echo MSAV has detected a virus on your current drive!
    goto exit
    :none
    echo MSAV found no viruses on your current drive.
    goto exit
    :exit

                                  MSBACKUP
 
Runs Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS, which backs up or restores one or more
files from one disk onto another.
 
Note:  MS-DOS also includes Microsoft Backup for Windows. Depending on the
       choices you made during MS-DOS Setup, you might have Backup for
       MS-DOS, Backup for Windows, both, or neither. This topic explains
       only Backup for MS-DOS; for information about Backup for Windows, see
       the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
You can back up all files on a disk or files that have changed since your
last backup, schedule backups so they are done automatically on a regular
basis, and restore files that you have backed up.
 
Syntax
 
MSBACKUP [setup_file] [/BW | /LCD | /MDA]
 
Parameter
 
setup_file
    Specifies the setup file that defines files to back up and the type of
    backup you want to perform. MSBACKUP creates a setup file when you save
    program settings and file selections. Setup files must have an SET
    extension. If you do not specify a setup file, MSBACKUP uses
    DEFAULT.SET.
 
Switches
 
/BW
    Starts MSBACKUP using a black-and-white color scheme.
 
/LCD
    Starts MSBACKUP using a video mode compatible with laptop displays.
 
/MDA
    Starts MSBACKUP using a monochrome display adapter.

                              MSBACKUPฤฤNotes
 
Must start MSBACKUP from a hard disk
 
MSBACKUP program files must be located on your hard disk. You cannot start
MSBACKUP from a floppy disk.
 
Backup catalogs
 
As part of the backup process, MSBACKUP creates a backup catalog that
contains information about the files you backed up. When you need to restore
one or more files, you can load the backup catalog and easily select files
from a backup set. The backup catalog includes information about the:
 
  Backed-up disk's directory structure.
 
  Names, sizes, and attributes of the directories and files that were
   selected.
 
  Total number of files.
 
  Total size of the backup.
 
  Name of the setup file that was used.
 
  Date the backup was made.
 
MSBACKUP gives each catalog file a unique name that helps you identify a
backup set. Each character in the catalog name contains information about a
particular backup set. For example, consider a typical catalog name such as
CD20823A.FUL. Reading left to right, the character(s) in the filename mean
the following:
 
Character(s)  Meaning
ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ
 
C             The first drive backed up in this set.
 
D             The last drive backed up in this set. (If only one drive was
              backed up, this letter will be the same as the first drive
              that was backed up.)
 
2             The last digit of the year, as determined by the system date.
              In the example, the year is 1992.
 
08            The month the backup set was created.
 
23            The day of the month the backup set was created.
 
A             The position in the sequence of this backup. If more than one
              backup of the same drive(s) is performed on the same day and
              the Keep Old Backup Catalogs option is set to On, MSBACKUP
              assigns a letter from A to Z to indicate the order in which
              the backups were performed (A is the first backup you created
              that day, B is the second, C the third, and so on). If the
              Keep Old Backup Catalogs option is set to Off, this alternates
              between A and B.
 
FUL           The backup typeฤฤFUL indicates a full backup, INC indicates an
              incremental backup, and DIF indicates a differential backup.
 
You can easily locate the catalog for a backup set by using the information
contained in the catalog filenames, even if you have many catalog files in
your directory.
 
Each time you perform a full backup using a specific setup file, MSBACKUP
creates a master catalog. The master catalog keeps track of all the backup
catalogs made during the backup cycle. When the next full backup is
performed and a new backup cycle begins, a new master catalog is created.
 
The master catalog is used if you need to restore a complete backup cycle.
When you load the master catalog, the catalogs of all the backups that were
created during the backup cycle are automatically merged. Then the latest
version of each backed-up file can be automatically restored (or you can
choose to restore an earlier version).
 
You can choose whether you want to keep all of the old catalogs or only the
current catalogs on your hard disk. The catalogs will remain part of your
backup sets.
 
When you back up files, MSBACKUP places one copy of the backup catalog on
your hard disk, and a second copy on the disk or network drive that contains
your backup set.
 
Insufficient memory
 
If you receive a message stating that you have insufficient memory, do the
following:
 
1  Make sure you have at lease 512K of memory on your computer.
 
2  Quit MSBACKUP, remove all memory-resident programs from memory, and try
   using MSBACKUP again.
 
3  Choose the Options button on the Backup screen to display the Disk Backup
   Options dialog box. Turn off the Compress Backup Data option and then
   choose OK.
 
The MSDOSDATA environment variable
 
Backup for MS-DOS uses the MSDOSDATA environment variable to determine the
location of configuration information, backup sets, and catalogs. Backup for
MS-DOS first searches for the MSDOSDATA environment variable. If this
environment variable is not defined, the program searches the directory from
which you started the program. If the program does not find the file, the
program creates it using default values and places it in the directory.
 
The MSDOSDATA environment variable is useful if you share the Backup for
MS-DOS program files with others, but use your own configuration. For
example, suppose the program files are located on drive P, a
read-and-execute-only network server, and you want to use your own
configuration, backup sets, and catalogs. To specify that Backup for MS-DOS
use the configuration information, backup sets, and catalogs located in the
BACKUP directory on your drive C, add the following line to your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
 
        set msdosdata=c:\backup
 
To start Backup for MS-DOS, type the following at the command line:
 
        p:\msbackup
 
Changes you make to the configuration of Backup for MS-DOS are saved in the
BACKUP directory on drive C.

                                   MSCDEX
 
Provides access to CD-ROM drives. MSCDEX can be loaded from your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file or from the command prompt. (The device driver that came
with your CD-ROM drive must be loaded from your CONFIG.SYS file. For more
information, see Notes.)
 
The MSCDEX command should not be used after Windows has started.
 
Syntax
 
    MSCDEX /D:driver [/D:driver2... ] [/E] [/K] [/S] [/V] [/L:letter]
    [/M:number]
 
Parameters
 
/D:driver1 [/D:driver2... ]
    Specifies the driver signature of the first CD-ROM device driver. The
    driver1 parameter must match the parameter specified by the /D switch on
    the CONFIG.SYS command that starts the corresponding CD-ROM device
    driver
 
    The MSCDEX command must include at least one /D switch. To install
    additional CD-ROM device drivers, specify an additional /D switch for
    each device driver.
 
/E
    Specifies that the CD-ROM driver be allowed to use expanded memory, if
    available, to store sector buffers.
 
/K
    Specifies that MS-DOS should recognize CD-ROM volumes encoded in Kanji.
    By default, MS-DOS does not recognize Kanji CD-ROM volumes.
 
/S
    Enables sharing of CD-ROM drives on MS-NET or Windows for Workgroups
    servers.
 
/V
    Directs MSCDEX to display memory statistics when it starts.
 
/L:letter
    Specifies the drive letter to assign to the first CD-ROM drive. If you
    have more than one CD-ROM drive, MS-DOS assigns additional CD-ROM drives
    subsequent available drive letters.
 
/M:number
    Specifies the number of sector buffers.

                               MSCDEXฤฤNotes
 
The CD-ROM device driver must be loaded
 
Your CONFIG.SYS file must include a DEVICE or DEVICEHIGH command that loads
the CD-ROM device driver that came with your CD-ROM drive. The CD-ROM
driver's command line should include a /D:drivername parameter. This
parameter assigns a driver name (also called a driver signature) to the
CD-ROM device driver.
 
The MSCDEX command must include a /D:drivername parameter that matches the
/D:drivername parameter on the CD-ROM device driver's command line. MSCDEX
uses the /D:drivername parameter to identify the correct CD-ROM device
driver. The driver name is usually a name similar to MSCD000. Each CD-ROM
device driver currently in use must have a unique driver name.
 
Limit on number of logical drives
 
The number of logical drive letters available on your computer can limit the
number of CD-ROM drives you can have. The number of logical drives is
determined by the LASTDRIVE command in your CONFIG.SYS file. By the time
MSCDEX loads, some of the available drive letters might be used by other
programs, such as a network or DoubleSpace.
 
SMARTDrive and MSCDEX
 
If you use SMARTDrive, make sure the MSCDEX command appears before the
SMARTDRV command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. SMARTDrive can significantly
speed up your CD-ROM drive by read-caching it. By default, when SMARTDrive
loads, it checks for the presence of MSCDEX; if MSCDEX is present, CD-ROM
caching is enabled. For more information, see the <SMARTDRV> command.

                              MSCDEXฤฤExamples
 
Loading and enabling a single CD-ROM device driver
 
This example shows the relevant CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT commands for a
computer with one CD-ROM drive.
 
The CONFIG.SYS file contains the following DEVICE command:
 
    device=c:\devices\cdromdrv.sys /d:mscd000
 
This command loads the device driver CDROMDRV.SYS, which came with the
CD-ROM drive. The AUTOEXEC.BAT file contains the following MSCDEX command:
 
    c:\dos\mscdex /d:mscd000 /l:g
 
This command enables the device driver that has the driver signature
MSCD000. The /E switch specifies that the driver be allowed to use expanded
memory, if available. The /L:G switch assigns the drive letter G to the
CD-ROM drive.
 
Loading and enabling more than one CD-ROM device driver
 
This example shows the relevant CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT commands for a
computer that has two CD-ROM drives from two different manufacturers.
 
The CONFIG.SYS file contains the following DEVICE commands:
 
    device = c:\aspi\aspicd.sys /d:mscd000
    device = c:\cdrom\tslcdr.sys /d:mscd001
 
Each command loads the device driver that came with that CD-ROM drive. The
AUTOEXEC.BAT file contains the following MSCDEX command:
 
    c:\dos\mscdex /d:mscd000 /d:mscd001 /l:j
 
This command enables both device drivers. The first driver has the driver
signature MSCD000; the second has the driver signature MSCD001. The /L:J
switch specifies that the first CD-ROM drive, MSCD000, will be drive J and
the second CD-ROM drive will be drive K.

Starting the MSD program
 
If you wanted to examine some of the technical information about your
computer before calling Microsoft Product Support Services, you would start
the MSD program by typing the following at the command prompt:
 
    msd
 
The MSD program has an interface that makes it easy for you to access
detailed technical information about your computer.
 
Creating a report
 
Before calling Microsoft Product Support Services, you could create a file
called COMPUTER.TXT that contains a detailed technical report about your
computer. To do this, you could type the following at the command prompt:
 
    msd /p computer.txt
 
The COMPUTER.TXT file would contain the information about your computer.
 
If you want MSD to create a detailed report about your computer and you
wanted the report to include such information as your name, company,
address, and phone number, you would type the following at the command
prompt:
 
    msd /f computer.txt
 
The MSD program will prompt you for the information.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                  NLSFUNC
 
Starts the Nlsfunc program, which loads country-specific information for
national language support (NLS).
 
You can use the NLSFUNC command either from the command line or within your
CONFIG.SYS file to support the use of country-specific information and
character set (code page) switching.
 
Do not use the NLSFUNC command while Windows is running. If you do, your
computer might stop responding.
 
Syntax
 
    NLSFUNC [[drive:][path]filename]
 
In your CONFIG.SYS file, use the following syntax:
 
    INSTALL=[[dos-drive:]dos-path]NLSFUNC.EXE [country-filename]
 
Parameters
 
[drive:][path]filename or country-filename
    Specifies the location and name of the file containing country-specific
    information. If you use this parameter in the INSTALL command, you must
    include the drive and directory.
 
[dos-drive:]dos-path
    Specifies the location of NLSFUNC.EXE.
 
Related Commands
 
For information about displaying the current character set (code page), see
the <CHCP> command.
 
For information about preparing a character set (code page), see the
<MODE (set device code pages)> command.

                               NLSFUNCฤฤNote
 
The default value for [drive:][path]filename is defined by the COUNTRY
command in your CONFIG.SYS file. If no COUNTRY command exists in CONFIG.SYS,
Nlsfunc looks for COUNTRY.SYS in the root directory of the startup drive.
Nlsfunc does not access the COUNTRY.SYS file until MS-DOS requests
information from it. If MS-DOS cannot find the COUNTRY.SYS file when you
install Nlsfunc, no error message is given. However, you will get an error
message if you subsequently run a CHCP command.

To use the default country-specific information found in the COUNTRY.SYS
file, type the following command:
 
    nlsfunc
 
Suppose you have a file called NEWCDPG.SYS that contains country-specific
information. If you want to use the information from that file rather than
from the COUNTRY.SYS file, type the following command:
 
    nslfunc newcdpg.sys

                                  NUMLOCK
 
Specifies whether the NUM LOCK key is set to ON or OFF when your computer
starts. You can use this command only in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
Syntax
 
    NUMLOCK=[ON|OFF]
 
Parameters
 
ON|OFF
    If set to ON, turns on the NUM LOCK key when MS-DOS displays the startup
    menu. If set to OFF, turns NUM LOCK off.
 
Related Commands
 
The NUMLOCK command is one of six special CONFIG.SYS commands for defining
startup menus and multiple configurations. The other commands are:
 
  The <MENUCOLOR> command, which defines the color of the menu's text and
   screen background.
 
  The <MENUITEM> command, which defines an item on the menu.
 
  The <MENUDEFAULT> command, which specifies the default menu item.
 
  The <SUBMENU> command, which defines a submenu.
 
  The <INCLUDE> command, which includes the contents of one configuration
   block in another. This command cannot be included in a menu block.
 
For an overview of the procedure for defining multiple configurations, see
the topic <Commands for Defining Multiple Configurations>
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                             NUMLOCK ฤฤ Example
 
To ensure that NUM LOCK is always ON when the startup menu appears, include
the following command in the [MENU] block.
 
For example, the following menu block defines three menu items, sets the
default item to "full_config," and sets NUM LOCK to ON:
 
    [menu]
    menuitem=base_config,Base configuration only
    menuitem=full_config,Normal configuration
    menuitem=network,Normal configuration with network
    menudefault=full_config
    numlock=on

                                    PATH
 
Indicates which directories MS-DOS should search for executable files.
 
MS-DOS uses the PATH command to search for executable files in the
directories you specify. By default, the search path is the current
directory only.
 
Syntax
 
    PATH [[drive:]path[;...]]
 
To display the current search path, use the following syntax:
 
    PATH
 
To clear all search-path settings other than the default setting (the
current directory), use the following syntax:
 
    PATH ;
 
Parameters
 
[drive:]path
    Specifies a drive, directory, and any subdirectories to search.
 
;
    When used as the only parameter, clears all search-path settings and
    specifies that MS-DOS is to search only the current directory.
 
Related Command
 
For information about setting a search path for data files, see the
<APPEND> command.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                PATHฤฤNotes
 
Current directory searched first
 
MS-DOS always searches in the current directory first, before it searches
directories in the search path.
 
Length limit for the PATH command
 
The maximum length of the PATH command is 127 characters. To fit more
directories in the search path, you can shorten directory names, use the
SUBST command to redirect directories to logical drives (which shortens the
entries on the PATH command line), or use the APPEND /X:ON command.
 
Files with the same name, different extensions
 
You might have some files in the same directory that share the same filename
but have different extensions. For example, you might have a file named
ACCNT.COM that starts an accounting program and another file named ACCNT.BAT
that connects your system to the accounting system network.
 
MS-DOS searches for a file by using default filename extensions in the
following order of precedence: .COM, .EXE, and .BAT. To run ACCNT.BAT when
ACCNT.COM exists in the same directory, you must include the .BAT extension
on the command line.
 
Two or more identical filenames in the PATH
 
You might have two or more files in the search path that have the same
filename and extension. MS-DOS searches for the specified filename first in
the current directory. Then it searches directories in the order in which
they are listed in the PATH command.
 
Specifying multiple directories in PATH command
 
To specify more than one path for MS-DOS to search, separate entries with a
semicolon (;).
 
Using PATH in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
 
If you place the PATH command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, MS-DOS
automatically initiates the specified search path every time you start your
computer.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                               PATHฤฤExample
 
The following command specifies that MS-DOS is to search three directories
to find commands (the three paths for these directories are C:\USER\TAXES,
B:\USER\INVEST, and B:\BIN):
 
    path c:\user\taxes;b:\user\invest;b:\bin

                                   PAUSE
 
Suspends processing of a batch program and displays a message that prompts
the user to press any key to continue. You can use this command only within
batch programs.
 
Syntax
 
    PAUSE
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                PAUSEฤฤNotes
 
Prompting the user to continue the program
 
MS-DOS displays the following message in response to the PAUSE command:
 
    Press any key to continue . . .
 
Dividing a batch file into sections
 
If you press CTRL+C to stop a batch program, MS-DOS displays the following
message:
 
    Terminate batch job (Y/N)?
 
If you press Y (for yes) in response to this message, the batch program ends
and control returns to the operating system. Therefore, you can insert the
PAUSE command before a section of the batch file you may not want to
process. While PAUSE suspends processing of the batch program, you can press
CTRL+C and then Y to stop the batch program.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                               PAUSEฤฤExample
 
Suppose you want a batch program to prompt the user to change disks in one
of the drives. To do this, you might create the following file:
 
    @echo off
    :begin
    copy a:*.*
    echo Please put a new disk into drive A
    pause
    goto begin
 
In this example, all the files on the disk in drive A are copied to the
current directory. After the displayed comment prompts you to place another
disk in drive A, the PAUSE command suspends processing so that you can
change disks and then press any key to resume processing. This particular
batch program runs in an endless loop. The GOTO BEGIN command sends the
command interpreter to the begin label of the batch file. To stop this batch
program, press CTRL+C and then Y.

and sets levels of power conservation.
 
Syntax
 
    POWER [ADV[:MAX|REG|MIN]|STD|OFF]
 
To display the current power setting, use the following syntax:
 
    POWER
 
Parameters
 
ADV[:MAX|REG|MIN]|STD|OFF
 
    ADV[:MAX|REG|MIN]
        Conserves power when applications and hardware devices are idle. In
        some cases, performance may be affected if an application is active
        instead of idle. Use MAX for maximum power conservation. Use REG,
        the default setting, to balance power conservation with application
        and device performance. Use MIN if the performance of an application
        or device is not satisfactory when you specify MAX or REG.
 
    STD
        If your computer supports the Advanced Power Management (APM)
        specification, STD conserves power by using only the
        power-management features of your computer's hardware. If your
        computer does not support the APM specification, STD turns off power
        management.

    COM3, and COM4. The default value is LPT1, which is also called PRN. The
    /D switch must precede any filename used on the command line.
 
/B:size
    Sets the size (in bytes) of the internal buffer, which is used to store
    data before it is sent to the printer. The minimum and default value for
    size is 512; the maximum value is 16384. Increasing this value decreases
    the amount of memory available for other purposes but may speed up the
    PRINT command.
 
/U:ticks1
    Specifies the maximum number of clock ticks PRINT is to wait for a
    printer to be available (clock ticks occur about 18 times per second).
    If the printer is not available within the time specified, the job does
    not print. Values for ticks1 must be in the range 1 through 255. The
    default value is 1.
 
/M:ticks2
    Specifies the maximum number of clock ticks PRINT can take to print a
    character on the printer. Values for ticks2 must be in the range 1
    through 255. The default value is 2. If a character is printed too
    slowly, MS-DOS displays an error message.
 
/S:ticks3
    Specifies the number of clock ticks the MS-DOS scheduler allocates for
    background printing. Values for ticks3 must be in the range 1 through
    255. The default value is 8. Increasing this value can speed up printing
    while slowing down other programs.
 
/Q:qsize
    Specifies the maximum number of files allowed in the print queue. Values
    for qsize must be in the range 4 through 32. The default value is 10.
 
/T
    Removes all files from the print queue.
 
/C
    Removes files from the print queue. You can use the /C and /P switches
    on the same command line.
 
    When the /C switch precedes the list of filenames on the command line,
    it applies to all files whose names follow the /C switch, until PRINT
    encounters a /P switch, in which case the /P switch applies to the file
    whose name precedes the /P switch.
 
    When the /C switch follows a filename, it applies to the file whose name
    precedes the /C switch and all files whose names follow the /C switch,
    until PRINT encounters a /P switch, in which case the /P switch applies
    to the file whose name precedes the /P switch.
 
/P
    Adds files to the print queue. You can use the /C and /P switches on the
    same command line.
 
    When the /P switch precedes the list of filenames on the command line,
    it applies to all files whose names follow the /P switch, until PRINT
    encounters a /C switch, in which case the /C switch applies to the file
    whose name precedes the /C switch.
 
    When the /P switch follows a filename, it applies to the file whose name
    precedes the /P switch and all files whose names follow the /P switch,
    until PRINT encounters a /C switch, in which case the /C switch applies
    to the file whose name precedes the /C switch.

                                PRINTฤฤNotes
 
Length of a PRINT queue entry
 
Each print queue entry can contain a maximum of 64 characters. Each queue
entry includes the drive letter, directory, and any subdirectories.
 
Limitations on switches
 
You can only use the /D, /B, /U, /M, /S, and /Q switches the first time you
use the PRINT command after starting MS-DOS. To use one of these switches
after using PRINT, you need to restart MS-DOS.
 
Use an application's print command when possible
 
Many applications have their own print commands. You should use an
application's print command to print files that you create with the
application.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                              PRINTฤฤExamples
 
To view the status of the print queue, type the following at the command
prompt:
 
    print
 
MS-DOS displays the name of the file being printed (if any), the names of
files in the queue, and an error message, if an error condition exists.
 
The following command removes the PENCIL.TST file from the print queue:
 
    print a:pencil.tst /c
 
The next command shows how to remove the file PENCIL.TST from the queue and
add the file PEN.TST to the queue:
 
    print pencil.tst /c pen.tst /p
 
The remaining examples use switches that work only with the first PRINT
command you use after starting MS-DOS.
 
The following command sets up the print queue for printing on LPT1:
 
    print /d:lpt1
 
To specify that the PRINT command is to wait 60 clock ticks for a printer to
be available and that the MS-DOS scheduler is to allocate 25 clock ticks to
the PRINT command for background printing rather than the default value of 8
clock ticks, type the following command:
 
    print /u:60 /s:25
 
The following example specifies that PRINT has 4 clock ticks available to
print each character rather than the default value of 2 clock ticks:
 
    print /m:4
 
To change the default maximum number of files for the print queue, use the
PRINT command with the /Q switch, as the following example shows:
 
    print /q:32

                                   PROMPT
 
Changes the appearance of the command prompt.
 
You can customize the command prompt to display any text you want, including
such information as the name of the current directory, the time and date,
and the MS-DOS version number.
 
Syntax
 
    PROMPT [text]
 
Parameter
 
text
    Specifies any text and information you want included in your system
    prompt.
 
    The following list shows the character combinations you can include
    instead of, or in addition to, any character string(s) in the text
    parameter. The list includes a brief description of the text or
    information that each character combination adds to your command
    prompt.
 
    $Q    = (equal sign)
    $$    $ (dollar sign)
    $T    Current time
    $D    Current date

                               PROMPTฤฤNotes
 
Using the PROMPT command without the text parameter
 
When you use the PROMPT command without specifying a value for text, PROMPT
resets the command prompt to the default settingฤฤthe current drive letter
followed by a greater-than sign (>).
 
Using the $P value for text
 
If you include the $P character in the text parameter, MS-DOS reads your
disk after you enter each command to determine the current drive and path.
This can take extra time, especially for floppy disk drives.
 
Defining the MS-DOS command prompt in Windows
 
If you use Microsoft Windows 3.1, you can change the command prompt with the
WINPMT environment variable.
 
For example, suppose you want the following message to precede the MS-DOS
command prompt:
 
    Type "exit" when you're ready to return to Windows.
 
To display this message, include the following command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file:
 
    set winpmt=Type "exit" when you're ready to return to Windows.$_$p$g
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                              PROMPTฤฤExamples
 
The following example sets the command prompt to display the current drive
and path followed by the greater-than sign (>):
 
    prompt $p$g
 
The following command displays a two-line prompt in which the current time
appears on the first line and the current date appears on the second line:
 
    prompt time is: $t$_date is: $d
 
If your CONFIG.SYS file loads ANSI.SYS, you can use ANSI escape sequences in
your prompts. The following command, for example, displays your prompt in
reverse video mode and returns to usual video mode for other text:
 
    prompt $e[7m$n:$e[m
 
The characters following the escape code ($E) are ANSI escape sequences.

                                   QBASIC
 
Starts MS-DOS QBasic, a program that reads instructions written in the Basic
computer language and interprets them into executable computer code.
 
The QBasic program provides a complete environment for programming in the
Basic language. QBasic includes extensive online Help. For more information
about using QBasic, press ENTER immediately after starting QBasic or press
F1 any time while running QBasic.
 
Syntax
 
    QBASIC [/B] [/EDITOR] [/G] [/H] [/MBF] [/NOHI]
    [[/RUN][drive:][path]filename]
 
Parameter
 
[drive:][path]filename
    Specifies the location and name of the file to load when QBasic starts.
 
Switches
 
/B
    Displays QBasic in black and white if you have a color monitor.
 
/EDITOR
    Invokes MS-DOS Editor, a full-screen text editor.
 
/G
    Provides the fastest update of a CGA monitor.
 
/H
    Displays the maximum number of display lines possible on your screen.
 
/MBF
    Converts the built-in functions MKS$, MKD$, CVS, and CVD to MKSMBF$,
    MKDMBF$, CVSMBF, and CVDMBF, respectively.
 
/NOHI
    Allows the use of a monitor that does not support high-intensity video.
    Do not use this switch with Compaq laptop computers.
 
/RUN
    Runs the specified Basic program before displaying it. You must specify
    a filename.

                               QBASICฤฤNotes
 
Cannot use MS-DOS Editor if MS-DOS QBasic is not present
 
To use MS-DOS Editor, you must have the QBASIC.EXE file in the current
directory, or in the same directory as the EDIT.COM file in your search
path. If you delete QBASIC.EXE to save space on your hard disk, you cannot
use MS-DOS Editor.
 
Running consecutive Basic programs
 
You can run consecutive Basic programs from a batch file by using the Basic
SYSTEM statement and the QBASIC command with the /RUN switch. A SYSTEM
statement quits QBASIC and returns control to MS-DOS after a Basic program
has run, instead of returning to QBasic. This allows you to run more than
one Basic program from a batch file without having to intervene.
 
Display of shortcut keys
 
Some monitors may not support the display of shortcut keys by default. If
your monitor does not display shortcut keys, use the /B switch (for CGA
monitors) and the /NOHI switch (for systems that do not support bold
characters).
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                RAMDRIVE.SYS
 
Uses part of your computer's random-access memory (RAM) to simulate a hard
disk drive. This device driver must be loaded by a <DEVICE> or <DEVICEHIGH>
command in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
RAM drives are much faster than hard disk drives because your computer can
read information faster from memory than from a hard disk. A RAM drive
appears to be a normal hard disk drive; you can use it just as you would any
hard disk drive. The most important difference between a real disk drive and
a RAM drive is that because it exists only in memory, information on a RAM
drive is lost when you turn off or restart your computer. You can set up as
many RAM drives as you want, up to the amount of memory your computer has.
To do this, add one RAMDRIVE.SYS line to your CONFIG.SYS file for each
additional RAM drive you want.
 
Syntax
 
    DEVICE=[drive:][path]RAMDRIVE.SYS [DiskSize SectorSize [NumEntries]]]
    [/E | /A]
 
Parameters
 
[drive:][path]
    Specifies the location of the RAMDRIVE.SYS file.
 
DiskSize
    Specifies how many kilobytes of memory you want to use for the RAM
    drive. For example, to create a 640K RAM drive, specify 640. If you
    don't specify an amount, RAMDrive will create a 64K RAM drive. You can
    specify a value from 4 to 32767. However, you cannot specify more memory
    than your system has available.
 
SectorSize
    Specifies the disk sector size in bytes. The size can be 128, 256, or
    512 bytes. (If you include a SectorSize value, you must also include a
    value for DiskSize.)
 
    Generally, you should use the default sector size of 512 bytes.
 
NumEntries
    Limits the number of files and directories you can create in the RAM
    drive's root directory. The limit can be from 2 to 1024 entries; the
    limit you specify is rounded up to the nearest sector size boundary. If
    you do not specify a limit, you can create up to 64 entries in the RAM
    drive's root directory. (If you include a value for NumEntries, you must
    also include values for DiskSize and SectorSize.)
 
    If there is not enough memory to create the RAM drive as specified,
    RAMDrive will try to create it with a limit of 16 directory entries.
    This may result in a RAM drive with a different limit from the one you
    specified.
 
Switches
 
/E
    Creates the RAM drive in extended memory.
 
    For RAMDrive to use extended memory, your system must be configured so
    that it provides extended memory, and a DEVICE command for the
    extended-memory manager (such as HIMEM.SYS) must appear in your
    CONFIG.SYS file before the DEVICE command for RAMDRIVE.SYS. In general,
    it is best to create a RAM drive in extended memory if your system has
    extended memory.
 
/A
    Creates the RAM drive in expanded memory.
 
    For RAMDrive to use expanded memory, your system must be configured so
    that it provides expanded memory, and the DEVICE command for the
    expanded-memory manager (such as EMM386, 386MAX, CEMM, or QEMM) must
    appear in your CONFIG.SYS file before DEVICE command for RAMDRIVE.SYS.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                            RAMDRIVE.SYSฤฤNotes
 
Using conventional memory
 
Although specifying a memory type is optional, it is strongly recommended.
If you omit both the /E and /A switches, RAMDRIVE.SYS uses your system's
conventional memory. It is not a good idea to use conventional memory for a
RAM drive, because this reduces available work space for programs. However,
if you don't have extended memory, expanded memory, or a hard disk drive,
you might want to use conventional memory for a RAM drive. A RAM drive can
increase the speed of a floppy disk system significantly enough that it may
be worth the loss of some conventional memory.
 
Using extended memory
 
If your system has extended memory installed (starting at the 1-megabyte
boundary), you can use this extended memory for one or more RAM drives. For
RAMDRIVE.SYS to use extended memory, you must first install HIMEM.SYS or
another extended-memory manager that conforms to the
Lotus/Intel/Microsoft/AST eXtended Memory Specification (XMS). In your
CONFIG.SYS file, the DEVICE command that installs the XMS extended-memory
manager must precede the commands that install the RAM drive.
 
Using expanded memory
 
For RAMDRIVE.SYS to use expanded memory, you must configure your system so
that it provides expanded memory. In your CONFIG.SYS file, the DEVICE
command that installs the expanded-memory manager (such as EMM386.EXE) must
precede the DEVICE command that installs RAMDRIVE.SYS. The expanded-memory
manager must conform to the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded Memory
Specification (LIM EMS).
 
Increasing the efficiency of a RAM drive
 
For the best results with a RAM drive, you can define a TEMP environment
variable and set it to a directory on the RAM drive. If you use Windows, be
sure the RAM drive is at least 2 MB in size; otherwise, there might not be
enough space to create temporary files for printing.
 
Compressing a RAMDrive
 
To compress a RAMDrive, use the <DBLSPACE /CREATE> command. Although it is
possible to compress a RAMDrive by using the DBLSPACE /COMPRESS command, it
is not recommended. Due to the inherent volatility of a RAMDrive,
DoubleSpace's automatic recovery mechanisms cannot work on a RAMDrive.
 
If you compress your RAMDrive, make sure the DEVICE command for RAMDRIVE.SYS
appears in your CONFIG.SYS file before the DEVICE command for DBLSPACE.SYS.
Otherwise, the compressed RAMDrive will not be automatically mounted when
your computer starts.

                           RAMDRIVE.SYSฤฤExamples
 
To create a RAM drive in extended memory and allocate 64K (the default
amount) of extended memory to RAMDRIVE.SYS, add the following line to your
CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    device=c:\dos\ramdrive.sys /e
 
This command loads RAMDRIVE.SYS from the C:\DOS directory.
 
Suppose you want to install RAMDRIVE.SYS in expanded memory and allocate 4
MB (4096K) of expanded memory to the RAM drive. To do this and to specify
that RAMDRIVE.SYS is located in the DOS directory on drive C, add the
following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    device=c:\dos\ramdrive.sys 4096 /a
 
Now suppose you want to allocate 2048K of extended memory to RAMDRIVE.SYS
and create a RAM drive that has 512-byte sectors and a limit of 1024 entries
in its root directory. To do this and to specify that RAMDRIVE.SYS is
located in the DEVICES directory on drive D, add the following line to your
CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    device=d:\devices\ramdrive.sys 2048 512 1024 /e
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                    REM
 
Enables you to include comments in a batch file or in your CONFIG.SYS file.
The REM command is also useful for disabling commands. (You can use a
semicolon (;) instead of the REM command in your CONFIG.SYS file, but not in
batch files.)
 
Syntax
 
    REM [string]
 
Parameters
 
string
    Specifies any string of characters ฤฤ the command you want to disable or
    the comment you want to include.

                                 REMฤฤNotes
 
Using the ECHO command to display comments
 
The REM command does not display comments on the screen. You must use the
ECHO ON command in your batch or CONFIG.SYS file in order to display
comments on the screen.
 
Restrictions on characters in batch-file comments
 
You cannot use a redirection character (> or <) or pipe (|) in a batch-file
comment.
 
Using REM to add vertical spacing
 
Although you can use REM without a comment to add vertical spacing to a
batch file, you can also use blank lines. MS-DOS ignores the blank lines
when processing the batch program.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                               REMฤฤExamples
 
The following example shows a batch file that uses remarks for both
explanations and vertical spacing:
 
    @echo off
    rem  This batch program formats and checks new disks.
    rem  It is named CHECKNEW.BAT.
    rem
    echo Insert new disk in drive B.
    pause
    format b: /v
    chkdsk b:
 
Suppose you want to include in your CONFIG.SYS file an explanatory comment
before the COUNTRY command. To do this, add the following lines to
CONFIG.SYS:
 
    rem Set country code to France
    country=033
 
The following example shows a DEVICE command that has been disabled by using
a semicolon (;) instead of the REM command:

                                RENAME (REN)
 
Changes the name of the file or files you specify.
 
You can rename all files matching the specified filename. You cannot use the
RENAME command to rename files across drives or to move files to a different
directory location. To rename subdirectories or move files, use the <MOVE>
command.
 
Syntax
 
    RENAME [drive:][path]filename1 filename2
 
    REN [drive:][path]filename1 filename2
 
Parameters
 
[drive:][path]filename1
    Specifies the location and name of the file or set of files you want to
    rename.
 
filename2
    Specifies the new name for the file or, if you use wildcards, the new
    names for the files. (You cannot specify a new drive or path.)

You can use wildcards (* and ?) in either filename parameter. If you use
wildcards in filename2, the characters represented by the wildcards will be
identical to the corresponding characters in filename1.
 
RENAME will not work if filename2 already exists
 
If, for filename2, you specify a filename that already exists, RENAME
displays the following message:

                                  REPLACE
 
Replaces files in a destination directory with files in a source directory
that have the same name. You can also use REPLACE to add unique filenames to
the destination directory.
 
Syntax
 
    REPLACE [drive1:][path1]filename [drive2:][path2] [/A] [/P] [/R] [/W]
 
    REPLACE [drive1:][path1]filename [drive2:][path2] [/P] [/R] [/S] [/W]
    [/U]
 
Parameters
 
[drive1:][path1]filename
    Specifies the location and name of the source file or set of files.
 
[drive2:][path2]
    Specifies the location of the destination file. You cannot specify a
    filename for files you replace. If you specify neither a drive nor a
    directory, REPLACE uses the current drive and directory as the
    destination.
 
Switches
 
/A
    Adds new files to the destination directory instead of replacing
    existing files. You cannot use this switch with the /S or /U switch.
 
/P
    Prompts you for confirmation before replacing a destination file or
    adding a source file.
 
/R
    Replaces read-only files as well as unprotected files. If you do not
    specify this switch but attempt to replace a read-only file, an error
    results and stops the replacement operation.
 
/S
    Searches all subdirectories of the destination directory and replaces
    matching files. You cannot use the /S switch with the /A switch. The
    REPLACE command does not search subdirectories specified in path1.
 
/W
    Waits for you to insert a disk before REPLACE begins to search for
    source files. If you do not specify /W, REPLACE begins replacing or
    adding files immediately after you press ENTER.
 
/U
    Replaces (updates) only those files on the destination directory that
    are older than those in the source directory. You cannot use the /U
    switch with the /A switch.

                               REPLACEฤฤNotes
 
REPLACE messages
 
As REPLACE adds or replaces files, MS-DOS displays their filenames on the
screen. After the REPLACE command is finished, MS-DOS displays a summary
line in one of the following formats:
 
    nnn files added
    nnn files replaced
 
    no file added
    no file replaced
 
Replacing files on a floppy disk system
 
If you have a floppy disk system and need to switch disks during the REPLACE
operation, you can specify the /W switch so that REPLACE will wait for you
to switch disks, as necessary.
 
Limitations on REPLACE
 
You cannot use the REPLACE command to update hidden files or system files
such as IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS. For information about changing hidden and
system attributes, see the  <ATTRIB> command.
 
REPLACE exit codes
 
The following list shows each exit code and a brief description of its
meaning:
 
0
    REPLACE successfully replaced or added the files.
 
1
    The computer has a version of MS-DOS that is incompatible with REPLACE.
 
2
    REPLACE could not find the source files.
 
3
    REPLACE could not find the source or destination path.
 
5
    The user does not have access to the files you want to replace.
 
8
    There is insufficient system memory to carry out the command.
 
11
    The user used the wrong syntax on the command line.
 
You can use the ERRORLEVEL parameter on the IF command line in a batch
program to process exit codes returned by REPLACE.
 
For an example of a batch program that processes exit codes, see the <IF>
command or the <CHOICE>command.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                             REPLACEฤฤExamples
 
Suppose that several directories on drive C contain different versions of a
file named PHONES.CLI, which contains client names and phone numbers. To
replace all of these files with the latest version of the PHONES.CLI file
from the disk in drive A, type the following command:
 
    replace a:\phones.cli c:\ /s
 
Suppose you want to add new printer device drivers to a directory on drive C
named TOOLS, which already contains several printer device-driver files for
a word processor. To do this, type the following command:
 
    replace a:*.prd c:\tools /a
 
This command searches the current directory on drive A for any files that
have the extension .PRD and then adds these files to the TOOLS directory on
drive C. Because the /A switch is included, REPLACE adds only those files
from drive A that do not exist on drive C.

                                  RESTORE
 
Restores files that were backed up by using any version of BACKUP from
MS-DOS versions 2.0 through 5.0. If you are restoring files that were backed
up using the MSBACKUP command in MS-DOS 6, use the <MSBACKUP> program to
restore files.
 
You can restore files from similar or dissimilar disk types.
 
Syntax
 
    RESTORE drive1: drive2:[path[filename]] [/S] [/P] [/B:date] [/A:date]
    [/E:time] [/L:time] [/M] [/N] [/D]
 
Parameters
 
drive1:
    Specifies the drive on which the backed-up files are stored.
 
drive2:
    Specifies the drive to which the backed-up files will be restored.
 
path
    Specifies the directory to which the backed-up files will be restored.
    You must specify the same directory from which the files were backed
    up.
 
filename
    Specifies the names of the backed-up files you want to restore.
 
Switches
 
/S
    Restores all subdirectories.
 
/P
    Prompts you for permission to restore files that are read-only (that
    have the read-only attribute set) or that have changed since the last
    backup (that have the archive attribute set).
 
/B:date
    Restores only those files last modified on or before the specified date.
    The format of date varies according to the COUNTRY setting in your
    CONFIG.SYS file. For information about specifying date, see the <DATE>
    command.
 
/A:date
    Restores only those files last modified on or after the specified date.
    The format of date varies according to the COUNTRY setting in your
    CONFIG.SYS file. For information about specifying date, see the <DATE>
    command.
 
/E:time
    Restores only those files last modified at or earlier than the specified
    time. The format of time varies according to the COUNTRY setting in your
    CONFIG.SYS file. For information about specifying time, see the <TIME>
    command.
 
/L:time
    Restores only those files last modified at or later than the specified
    time. The format of time varies according to the COUNTRY setting in your
    CONFIG.SYS file. For information about specifying time, see the <TIME>
    command.
 
/M
    Restores only those files modified since the last backup.
 
/N
    Restores only those files that no longer exist on the destination disk.
 
/D
    Displays a list of the files on the backup disk that match the names
    specified in filename without restoring any files. Even though no files
    are being restored, you must specify drive2 when you use /D.
 
Related Command
 
For information about backing up files, see the <MSBACKUP> command.

                               RESTOREฤฤNotes
 
Checking restored files
 
Once a file has been restored, you can use the DIR or TYPE command to make
sure the file was restored properly.
 
Limitations on RESTORE
 
You cannot use the RESTORE command to restore system files (IO.SYS and
MSDOS.SYS). RESTORE does not work with drives that have been redirected with
the ASSIGN or JOIN command.
 
Compatibility with previous versions of BACKUP
 
The MS-DOS 6 RESTORE command can restore files that were backed up by using
the BACKUP command in MS-DOS versions 2.0 through 5.0.
 
RESTORE exit codes
 
The following list shows each exit code and a brief description of its
meaning:
 
0
    RESTORE successfully restored the file or files.
 
1
    RESTORE could not find the files to restore.
 
3
    The user pressed CTRL+C to stop the restoring operation.
 
4
    RESTORE stopped because of an error.
 
You can use the ERRORLEVEL parameter on the IF command line in a batch
program to process exit codes returned by RESTORE.
 
For an example of a batch program that processes exit codes, see the <IF>
command or the <CHOICE>command.
 
Listing the names of backed-up files
 
Use the /D switch to see a list of the backed up files. If you specify
filename with the /D switch, RESTORE displays a list of the backed up files
that match the name you specify. If you use the /D switch, RESTORE does not
restore any files.
 
Restoring to different drives
 
While you must restore files to their original directory, you can restore
them to a different drive. For example, files backed up from the
C:\MYFILES\*.* directory can be restored to the D:\MYFILES\*.* directory.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                             RESTOREฤฤExamples
 
To restore the file INVEST.MNT from the backup disk in drive A to the IRS
directory on drive C, type the following command:
 
    restore a: c:\irs\invest.mnt
 
MS-DOS prompts you to insert the backup disk into drive A. Once the backup
disk is in drive A, press ENTER to continue.
 
Suppose you backed up all of the files in the directory \USER\ADAMS on drive
C. To restore these files, insert the backup disk in drive A and type the
following command:
 
    restore a: c:\user\adams\*.*
 
It is important that you specify *.* for filename. Otherwise, the RESTORE
command attempts to restore a file named ADAMS in the USER directory.
 
To restore a complete hard disk from a backup disk (or disks) in drive A,
type the following command:
 
    restore a: c:\*.* /s
 
The /S switch and the wildcards (*.*) specify that RESTORE is to restore all
backed-up files to their original directories and subdirectories on drive
C.

                                 RMDIR (RD)
 
Deletes (removes) a directory.
 
Before you can delete a directory, you must delete its files and
subdirectories. The directory must be empty except for the "." and ".."
symbols.
 
Syntax
 
    RMDIR [drive:]path
 
    RD [drive:]path
 
Parameter
 
[drive:]path
    Specifies the location and name of the directory you want to delete.

                                RMDIRฤฤNotes
 
Cannot delete directory with hidden or system files
 
You cannot delete a directory that contains files, including hidden or
system files. If you attempt to do so, MS-DOS displays the following
message:
 
    Invalid path, not directory,
    or directory not empty
 
Use the <DIR>  command to list hidden and system files and the <ATTRIB>
command to remove hidden and system attributes from files. For more
information, see those commands.
 
Using the backslash character with the path parameter
 
If you insert a backslash (\) before the first directory name in path,
MS-DOS treats the directory as a subdirectory of the root
directoryฤฤregardless of your current directory. If you do not insert a
backslash before the first directory name in path, MS-DOS treats the
directory as a subdirectory of the current directory.
 
Deleting the current directory
 
You cannot use RMDIR to delete the current directory. You must first change
to a different directory (not a subdirectory of the current directory) and
then use RMDIR with a path. If you attempt to delete the current directory,
MS-DOS displays a message in the following format:
 
    Attempt to remove current directory - drive:path
 
MS-DOS also displays this message if you attempt to delete a directory that
has been redirected by using the SUBST command.

                               RMDIRฤฤExample
 
To delete a directory named \USER\SMITH, first ensure that the directory is
empty, as in the following example:
 
    dir \user\smith /a
 
MS-DOS should display only the "." and ".." symbols.
 
Then, from any directory except \USER\SMITH, type the following command:
 
    rmdir \user\smith
 
You can type the following command with the same result:
 
    rd \user\smith

                                  SCANDISK
 
Starts Microsoft ScanDisk, a disk analysis and repair tool that checks a
drive for errors and corrects any problems that it finds. For an
introduction to using ScanDisk, see <An Introduction to ScanDisk>.
 
Syntax
 
To check the current drive for disk errors, use the following syntax:
 
    SCANDISK
 
To check one or more drives for disk errors, use the following syntax:
 
    SCANDISK [drive: [drive: ...]|/ALL] [/CHECKONLY | /AUTOFIX [/NOSAVE] |
    /CUSTOM] [/SURFACE] [/MONO] [/NOSUMMARY]
 
To check an unmounted DoubleSpace compressed volume file for errors, use the
following syntax:
 
    SCANDISK volume-name [/CHECKONLY | /AUTOFIX [/NOSAVE] | /CUSTOM] [/MONO]
    [/NOSUMMARY]
 
To check a file or files for fragmentation, use the following syntax:
 
    SCANDISK /FRAGMENT [drive:][path]filename
 
To undo repairs you made previously, use the following syntax:
 
    SCANDISK /UNDO [undo-drive:] [/MONO]
 
Parameters
 
drive:
    Specifies the drive or drives you want to check and repair.
 
volume-name
    Specifies the name of the unmounted DoubleSpace volume file you want to
    check and repair. The volume-name parameter should take the form
    [drive:\]DBLSPACE.nnn, in which drive specifies the drive that contains
    the volume file and nnn specifies the extension of the volume file. For
    example, H:\DBLSPACE.000.
 
[drive:][path]filename
    Specifies the file(s) you want to examine for fragmentation. You can
    also specify wildcards for the filename.
 
undo-drive:
    Specifies the drive containing the Undo disk.
 
Switches
 
/ALL
    Checks and repairs all local drives.
 
/AUTOFIX
    Fixes damage without prompting you first. By default, if you start
    ScanDisk with the /AUTOFIX switch and ScanDisk finds lost clusters on
    your drive, it saves the lost clusters as files in the drive's root
    directory. To have ScanDisk delete lost clusters rather than saving
    them, include the /NOSAVE switch. (If you use the /AUTOFIX switch and
    ScanDisk finds errors, it still prompts you for an Undo disk; to prevent
    this, include the /NOSUMMARY switch.) You cannot use the /AUTOFIX switch
    in conjunction with the /CHECKONLY or /CUSTOM  switches.
 
/CHECKONLY
    Checks a drive for errors, but does not repair any damage. You cannot
    use this switch with the /AUTOFIX or /CUSTOM switches.
 
/CUSTOM
    Runs ScanDisk using the configuration settings in the [Custom] section
    of the SCANDISK.INI file. This switch is especially useful for running
    ScanDisk from a batch program. You cannot use this switch in conjunction
    with the /AUTOFIX or /CHECKONLY switches.
 
/MONO
    Configures ScanDisk to use a monochrome display. Instead of specifying
    this switch every time you run ScanDisk, you can include the
    DISPLAY=MONO line in your SCANDISK.INI file.
 
/NOSAVE
    Directs ScanDisk to delete any lost clusters it finds. Can be used only
    in conjunction with the /AUTOFIX switch. (If you start ScanDisk with the
    /AUTOFIX switch and omit the /NOSAVE switch, ScanDisk saves the contents
    of any lost clusters as files in the root directory of the drive.)
 
/NOSUMMARY
    Prevents ScanDisk from displaying a full-screen summary after checking
    each drive. (This switch also prevents ScanDisk from prompting you for
    an Undo disk if it finds errors.)
 
/SURFACE
    Automatically performs a surface scan after checking other areas of a
    drive. During a surface scan of an uncompressed drive, ScanDisk confirms
    that data can be reliably written and read from the drive being scanned.
    During a surface scan of a DoubleSpace drive, ScanDisk confirms that
    data can be decompressed. You should periodically do surface scans of
    all drives.
 
    By default, when it has finished checking a drive's file system,
    ScanDisk asks whether or not you want to perform a surface scan.
    However, if you specify the /SURFACE switch, ScanDisk proceeds with the
    surface scan without prompting you first. When /SURFACE is used in
    conjunction with the /CUSTOM switch, it overrides the Surface setting in
    the [Custom] section of the SCANDISK.INI file.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                              SCANDISKฤฤNotes
 
Problems fixed by ScanDisk
 
ScanDisk checks and fixes problems in the following areas:
 
  File allocation table (FAT)
 
  File system structure (lost clusters, crosslinked files)
 
  Directory tree structure
 
  Physical surface of the drive (bad clusters)
 
  DoubleSpace volume header (MDBPB)
 
  DoubleSpace volume file structure (MDFAT)
 
  DoubleSpace compression structure
 
  DoubleSpace volume signatures
 
  MS-DOS boot sector
 
Types of drives
 
ScanDisk can find and fix errors on the following types of drives:
 
  Hard drives
 
  DoubleSpace drives
 
  Floppy disk drives
 
  RAM drives
 
  Memory cards
 
ScanDisk cannot find or fix errors on the following types of drives:
 
  CD-ROM drives
 
  Network drives
 
  Drives created by using the ASSIGN, SUBST, or JOIN commands
 
  Drives created by using INTERLNK
 
Using ScanDisk when other programs are running
 
Do not use ScanDisk to repair a drive when other programs are running.
ScanDisk is designed for use when files on a disk are in an unchanging
state. When you are using a file, MS-DOS updates the file allocation table
(FAT) and the directory structure to reflect changes. Such updates are not
always made immediately. If you run ScanDisk when other programs are
running, files might still be open. ScanDisk interprets differences between
the directory structure and the file allocation tables as errors. This can
result in corruption or loss of data.
 
You cannot use ScanDisk to correct disk errors if you start it from another
program, or when Microsoft Windows or MS-DOS Task Swapper are running.
However, you can check your disk without fixing errors by using the SCANDISK
command with the /CHECKONLY switch. If you run it with Windows, ScanDisk
might detect errors that do not exist when Windows is not running.
 
The SCANDISK.INI file
 
The SCANDISK.INI file is a text file located in the directory that contains
your MS-DOS files. The settings in the [Environment] section of the
SCANDISK.INI file determine certain aspects of ScanDisk's behavior, such as
whether it is configured for a monochrome or color display. The settings in
the [Custom] section determine the default behavior of ScanDisk when you
start it with the /CUSTOM switch.
 
For more information, read the comments in the SCANDISK.INI file.
 
Undoing the changes ScanDisk made
 
If ScanDisk finds errors on your drive, the program gives you the option of
creating an Undo disk, which enables you to undo the changes ScanDisk makes
to your drive. The Undo disk contains information that specifies which drive
it applies to as well as information on every change that ScanDisk made to
that drive.
 
CAUTION:  Use the Undo disk to undo changes only if your drive has not
          changed since that Undo disk was created. If you changed any of
          the files on your drive since you created the Undo disk, do not
          try to undo your changes. If you attempt to use the Undo disk
          after you update a file or directory, or copy or delete a file,
          you might damage your drive structure and lose data.
 
ScanDisk Errorlevels
 
When ScanDisk returns to the command prompt, it sets ERRORLEVEL to one of
the following:
 
0
    ScanDisk did not detect any problems on the drive(s) it checked.
 
1
    ScanDisk could not run because the command-line syntax was incorrect.
 
2
    ScanDisk terminated unexpectedly due to an out-of-memory error or an
    internal error.
 
3
    The user chose to exit before ScanDisk had finished.
 
4
    ScanDisk completed all logical checks on all drives, but the user exited
    from one or more surface scans before the scans were complete.
    Errorlevel 4 is not returned if the user chose to bypass the surface
    scans completely.
 
254
    ScanDisk found disk problems and corrected them all.
 
255
    ScanDisk found disk problems, but not all problems were corrected.

                             SCANDISKฤฤExamples
 
To check and fix the current drive, type the following:
 
    scandisk
 
Suppose that DoubleSpace is unable to mount your compressed drive because of
problems with the drive. The drive's compressed volume file is called
DBLSPACE.000 and is located in the root directory of drive C. To repair the
volume file, type the following:
 
    scandisk c:\dblspace.000
 
The DoubleSpace volume file must be located in the root directory of the
drive.
 
To check both drive C and drive E, type the following:
 
    scandisk c: e:
 
To check all your drives, type the following:
 
    scandisk /all
 
This will check all your hard disk partitions, in addition to all mounted
DoubleSpace drives.
 
Suppose you created an Undo disk, did not change the contents of the checked
drive since you created the Undo disk, and placed the Undo disk in drive A.
To undo the changes made by ScanDisk,  type the following:
 
    scandisk /undo a:
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                    SET
 
Displays, sets, or removes MS-DOS environment variables.
 
You use environment variables to control the behavior of some batch files
and programs and to control the way MS-DOS appears and works. The SET
command is often used in the AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS files to set
environment variables each time you start MS-DOS.
 
Syntax
 
    SET variable=[string]
 
To display the current environment settings, use the following syntax:
 
    SET
 
Parameters
 
variable
    Specifies the variable you want to set or modify.
 
string
    Specifies the string you want to associate with the specified variable.

                                 SETฤฤNotes
 
Displaying the current environment settings
 
When you type the SET command alone, MS-DOS displays the current environment
settings. These settings usually include the COMSPEC and PATH environment
variables that MS-DOS uses to help find programs on disk. PROMPT, DIRCMD and
COPYCMD are some other environment variables that MS-DOS uses. For more
information about DIRCMD, see the <DIR> command.
 
Using parameters
 
When you use a SET command and specify values for both variable and string,
MS-DOS adds the specified variable value to the environment and associates
the string with that variable. If the variable already exists in the
environment, the new string value replaces the old string value.
 
If you specify only a variable and an equal sign (without a string) for the
SET command, MS-DOS clears the string value associated with the variable (as
if the variable is not there at all).
 
Using SET in batch files
 
When creating batch files, you can use the SET command to create variables
and use them in the same way as you would the numbered variables %0 through
%9. You can also use the variables %0 through %9 as input for the SET
command.
 
Calling a SET variable from a batch file
 
When you call a variable value from a batch file, you must enclose the value
with percent signs (%). For example, if your batch program creates an
environment variable named BAUD, you can use the string associated with BAUD
as a replaceable parameter by inserting %BAUD% on the command line.
 
Effect of SET on environment space
 
After you use a SET command, MS-DOS might display the following message:
 
    Out of environment space
 
This message means the available environment space is insufficient to hold
the new variable definition. For information about how to increase the
environment space, see the <COMMAND> command.
 
Using the COPYCMD environment variable
 
You can set the COPYCMD environment variable to specify whether you want the
COPY, MOVE, and XCOPY commands to prompt you for confirmation before
overwriting a file, whether issued from the command prompt or a batch file.
 
To force the COPY, MOVE, and XCOPY commands to prompt you before overwriting
in all cases, set the COPYCMD environment variable to /-Y. To force these
commands to overwrite in all cases without prompting you, set the COPYCMD
environment variable to /Y.
 
Typing any of these commands with the /Y or /-Y switch overrides all
defaults and the current setting of the COPYCMD environment variable.

                               SETฤฤExamples
 
To set an environment variable named INCLUDE so that the string C:\INC (the
INC directory on drive C) is associated with it, type the following
command:
 
    set include=c:\inc
 
You can then use the string C:\INC in batch files by enclosing the name
INCLUDE with percent signs (%). For example, you might include the following
command in a batch file in order to display the contents of the directory
associated with the INCLUDE environment variable:
 
    dir %include%
 
When MS-DOS processes this command, the string C:\INC replaces %INCLUDE%.
 
Another possible use for the SET command is in a batch program that adds a
new directory to the PATH environment variable, as the following example
shows:
 
    @echo off
    rem ADDPATH.BAT adds a new directory
    rem to the PATH environment variable.
    set path=%1;%path%
    set

                                   SETVER
 
Displays the version table. Reports a version number (earlier than 6.0) to
programs or device drivers that were designed for earlier versions of
MS-DOS.
 
You can also use this command to display and modify the version table, which
lists names of programs and the number of the MS-DOS version with which they
are designed to run. If you are using a program that has not been updated
for MS-DOS 6, you can add its name to the version table by using the SETVER
command.
 
Syntax
 
    SETVER [drive:path][filename n.nn]
 
    SETVER [drive:path][filename [/DELETE [/QUIET]]
 
To display the current version table, use the following syntax:
 
    SETVER [drive:path]
 
MS-DOS displays two columns: the left column lists the names of the program
files; the right column lists the corresponding MS-DOS version with which
each file is set to run.
 
Parameters
 
[drive:path]
    Specifies the location of the SETVER.EXE file.
 
filename
    Specifies the name of the program file (usually an .EXE or .COM file)
    that you want to add to the version table. You cannot use a wildcard
    character (* or ?).
 
n.nn
    Specifies the MS-DOS version (for example, 3.3 or 4.01) that MS-DOS 6
    reports to the specified program file.
 
Switches
 
/DELETE
    Deletes the version-table entry for the specified program file. You can
    abbreviate this switch as /D.
 
/QUIET
    Hides the message typically displayed during deletion of an entry from
    the version table.
 
Related Command
 
For information about loading the version table into MS-DOS, see the
<SETVER.EXE> command.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                               SETVERฤฤNotes
 
SETVER confirmation
 
If you make changes to the version table and no errors are detected, MS-DOS
displays the following message:
 
    WARNING - Contact your software vendor for information about whether a
    specific program works with MS-DOS 6. It is possible that Microsoft has
    not verified whether the program will successfully run if you use the
    SETVER command to change the program version number and version table.
    If you run the program after changing the version table in MS-DOS 6, you
    may lose or corrupt data or introduce system instabilities. Microsoft is
    not responsible for any loss or damage, or for lost or corrupted data.
 
    Version table successfully updated
 
    The version change will take effect the next time you restart your
    system.
 
Loading the version table into memory
 
Before you can use the SETVER command, the version table must be loaded into
memory by a <DEVICE> command in your CONFIG.SYS file. By default, the MS-DOS
Setup program modifies your CONFIG.SYS file to ensure that the version table
is loaded into memory each time you start your system.
 
Setting the version number of a command interpreter
 
You can use SETVER to set the version number of a command interpreter;
however, if you set the version number of the MS-DOS 6 command interpreter
(COMMAND.COM), you may not be able to start your system.
 
Using the version table
 
Many programs designed to run with a previous version of MS-DOS will run
correctly with MS-DOS 6. In some cases, however, a program might not run
correctly unless its name is included in the version table. The table
indicates to the program that it is running with the MS-DOS version for
which it was designed, even though it is running with MS-DOS 6. By
interpreting MS-DOS 6 as the earlier version, the program will probably run
correctly; however, using SETVER will not solve the problem if the program
is not compatible with MS-DOS 6.
 
Restarting after updating the version table
 
When you update the version table by adding or deleting entries, you must
restart your system before the changes will take effect.
 
Updating existing entries
 
If you specify a filename that is already in the version table, the new
entry replaces the existing entry.
 
SETVER exit codes
 
The following list shows each exit code and a brief description of its
meaning:
 
0
    SETVER successfully completed its task.
 
1
    The user specified an invalid command switch.
 
2
    The user specified an invalid filename.
 
3
    There is insufficient system memory to carry out the command.
 
4
    The user specified an invalid version-number format.
 
5
    SETVER could not find the specified entry in the version table.
 
6
    SETVER could not find the SETVER.EXE file.
 
7
    The user specified an invalid drive.
 
8
    The user specified too many command-line parameters.
 
9
    SETVER detected missing command-line parameters.
 
10
    SETVER detected an error while reading the SETVER.EXE file.
 
11
    The SETVER.EXE file is corrupt.
 
12
    The specified SETVER.EXE file does not support a version table.
 
13
    There is insufficient space in the version table for a new entry.
 
14
    SETVER detected an error while writing to the SETVER.EXE file.
 
You can use the ERRORLEVEL parameter on the IF command line in a batch
program to process exit codes returned by SETVER. For an example of a batch
program that processes exit codes, see the <IF> command or the <CHOICE>
command.

                              SETVERฤฤExamples
 
Suppose you have a program file named MYPROG.EXE that runs with MS-DOS
version 3.30. To run MYPROG.EXE, you must first use the SETVER command to
create an entry in the version table that will cause MYPROG.EXE to interpret
MS-DOS 6 as version 3.30:
 
    setver myprog.exe 3.30
 
To delete the MYPROG.EXE entry from the version table (without otherwise
affecting the MYPROG.EXE file), type the following command:
 
    setver myprog.exe /delete
 
To list the contents of the version table on drive C, type the following
command:
 
    setver c:
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                 SETVER.EXE
 
Loads the MS-DOS version table into memory. This device driver must be
loaded by a <DEVICE> or <DEVICEHIGH> command in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
SETVER.EXE loads into memory the MS-DOS version table, which lists names of
programs and the number of the MS-DOS version with which each program is
designed to run.
 
Syntax
 
    DEVICE=[drive:][path]SETVER.EXE
 
Parameters
 
[drive:][path]
    Specifies the location of the SETVER.EXE file.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                              SETVER.EXEฤฤNote
 
If you are using SETVER to report a different MS-DOS version for a device
driver, the DEVICE command loading SETVER.EXE must appear in your CONFIG.SYS
file before the DEVICE command loading the other device driver.

                                   SHARE
 
Starts the Share program, which installs file-sharing and locking
capabilities on your disks and network drives.
 
Syntax
 
    SHARE [/F:space] [/L:locks]
 
In your CONFIG.SYS file, use the following syntax:
 
    INSTALL=[[drive:]path]SHARE.EXE [/F:space] [/L:locks]
 
Parameter
 
[drive:]path
    Specifies the location of the SHARE.EXE file.
 
Switches
 
/F:space
    Allocates file space (in bytes) for the MS-DOS storage area used to
    record file-sharing information. The default value is 2048.
 
/L:locks
    Sets the number of files that can be locked at one time. The default
    value is 20.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                SHAREฤฤNotes
 
Common use of Share
 
Typically, you use SHARE in a network or multitasking environment in which
programs share files. SHARE loads the code that supports file-sharing and
locking in these environments. Once you install Share, MS-DOS uses the code
loaded by Share to validate all read and write requests from programs. For
example, if two people are accessing the same data file, SHARE manages the
file so both people do not write to the file at the same time.
 
Allocating space for file-sharing information
 
When deciding how many bytes to allocate for file sharing, note that each
open file requires enough space for the length of the full path and
filename. The average length of a filename and its path is 20 bytes.
 
Using Share with Microsoft Flash File System
 
Share may be required in order to run some applications with Microsoft Flash
File System.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                              SHAREฤฤExamples
 
The following example shows how you can use the INSTALL command in your
CONFIG.SYS file to load Share, with the default values for the /F and /L
switches. MS-DOS searches for the file SHARE.EXE in the DOS directory on
drive C.
 
    install=c:\dos\share.exe
 
The following example allocates 4096 bytes for storing file-sharing
information and specifies that 25 files can be locked at one time. Again,
MS-DOS searches for SHARE.EXE in the DOS directory on drive C:
 
    install=c:\dos\share.exe /f:4096 /l:25
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                   SHELL
 
Specifies the name and location of the command interpreter you want MS-DOS
to use. You can use this command only in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
If you want to use your own command interpreter (instead of COMMAND.COM),
you can specify its name by adding a SHELL command to your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
Syntax
 
    SHELL=[[drive:]path]filename [parameters]
 
Parameters
 
[[drive:]path]filename
    Specifies the location and name of the command interpreter you want
    MS-DOS to use.
 
parameters
    Specifies any command-line parameters or switches that can be used with
    the specified command interpreter.
 
Related Command
 
For information about COMMAND.COM switches, see the <COMMAND> command.

                                SHELLฤฤNotes
 
Default setting
 
The default command interpreter for MS-DOS is COMMAND.COM. If you do not use
a SHELL command in your CONFIG.SYS file, MS-DOS searches for COMMAND.COM in
the root directory of your startup drive. You need to use the SHELL command
if you want to specify a COMMAND.COM file that is not in the root directory
or if you do not want to use the default environment size for COMMAND.COM.
For information about COMMAND.COM switches, see the <COMMAND> command.
 
Using switches with a command interpreter
 
The SHELL command itself does not accept any switches, but if the command
interpreter does, you can include them on the SHELL command line.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                              SHELLฤฤExamples
 
Suppose the file NEWSHELL.COM is in a directory named BIN on your startup
drive, and suppose you want to use NEWSHELL.COM as your command interpreter.
To do this, add the following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    shell=\bin\newshell.com
 
Suppose you add the line SHELL=NEWCMDP.COM to your CONFIG.SYS file, and
suppose the NEWCMDP.COM command interpreter accepts the switches /C, /P, and
/E. You can now use any of these switches on the SHELL command line. Thus,
the following command would be valid:
 
    shell=newcmdp.com /c /p /e
 
The SHELL command is the preferred method of using COMMAND to increase the
size of the environment. To increase the environment size to 512 bytes, add
the following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    shell=command.com /e:512 /p
 
To start an MS-DOS command interpreter located in the directory OLD on drive
C, add the following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    shell=c:\old\command.com c:\old /e:256 /p
 
For information about COMMAND.COM switches, see the <COMMAND> command.

                                   SHIFT
 
Changes the position of replaceable parameters in a batch program.
 
Syntax
 
    SHIFT
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                SHIFTฤฤNotes
 
How the SHIFT command works
 
The SHIFT command changes the values of the replaceable parameters %0
through %9 by copying each parameter into the previous one. In other words,
the value of %1 is copied to %0, the value of %2 is copied to %1, and so on.
This is useful for writing a batch file that performs the same operation on
any number of parameters.
 
Working with more than 10 command-line parameters
 
You can also use the SHIFT command to create a batch file that can accept
more than 10 parameters. If you specify more than 10 parameters on the
command line, those that appear after the tenth (%9) will be shifted one at
a time into %9.
 
Shifting parameters back
 
There is no backward SHIFT command. Once you carry out the SHIFT command,
you cannot recover the first parameter (%0) that existed before the shift.

The following batch file, MYCOPY.BAT, shows how to use the SHIFT command
with any number of parameters. It copies a list of files to a specific
directory. The parameters are the directory name followed by any number of
filenames.
 
    @echo off
    rem MYCOPY.BAT copies any number of files
    rem to a directory.
    rem The command uses the following syntax:
    rem mycopy dir file1 file2 ...
    set todir=%1
    :getfile
    shift
    if "%1"=="" goto end
    copy %1 %todir%

                                 SIZER.EXE
 
Used by the MemMaker memory-optimization program to determine the size in
memory of device drivers and memory-resident programs.
 
During optimization, MemMaker adds SIZER.EXE to the beginning of each
CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT command that starts a driver or program. When the
optimization process is complete, MemMaker removes SIZER.EXE from each
command line.
 
This program is used exclusively by MemMaker.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                  SMARTDRV
 
Starts or configures SMARTDrive, which creates a disk cache in extended
memory. A disk cache can significantly speed up MS-DOS disk operations. When
used for disk caching, SMARTDrive is loaded by using the SMARTDRV command in
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or at the command prompt.
 
SMARTDrive can also perform double buffering, which provides compatibility
for hard-disk controllers that cannot work with memory provided by EMM386 or
Windows running in 386 enhanced mode. To use double buffering, load the
<SMARTDRV.EXE> device driver by using a DEVICE command in your CONFIG.SYS
file.
 
SMARTDrive will not load after Windows has started.
 
Syntax
 
When starting SMARTDrive from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or from the command
prompt, use the following syntax:
 
    [drive:][path]SMARTDRV [/X] [[drive[+|-]]...] [/U] [/C|/R] [/F|/N] [/L]
    [/V|/Q|/S] [InitCacheSize[WinCacheSize]] [/E:ElementSize]
    [/B:BufferSize]
 
Once SMARTDrive is running, use the following syntax:
 
    SMARTDRV [/X] [[drive[+|-]]...] [/C|/R] [/F|/N] [/Q|/S]
 
To view the current status after SMARTDrive has loaded, use the following
syntax:
 
    SMARTDRV
 
Parameters
 
[drive:][path]
    Specifies the location of the SMARTDRV.EXE file.
 
[[drive+|-]
    Specifies the letter of the disk drive for which you want to control
    caching. Include the plus (+) sign to enable caching for the specified
    drive; include the minus (-) sign to disable caching for that drive. You
    can specify multiple disk drives.
 
    If you specify a drive letter without a plus or minus sign, read-caching
    is enabled and write-caching is disabled. If you specify a drive letter
    followed by a plus sign (+), read-caching and write-caching are enabled.
    If you specify a drive letter followed by a minus sign (-), both
    read-caching and write-caching are disabled. If you don't specify a
    drive letter, floppy disk drives, CD-ROM drives, and drives created
    using Interlnk are read-cached but not write-cached, hard disk drives
    are both read-cached and write-cached, and network drives and Microsoft
    Flash memory-card drives are ignored. (For information about how
    DoubleSpace caches compressed drives, see Notes.)
 
InitCacheSize
    Specifies the size in kilobytes of the cache when SMARTDrive starts
    (when Windows is not running). The size of the disk cache affects how
    efficiently SMARTDrive runs. In general, the larger the cache, the less
    often SMARTDrive needs to read information from the disk, which speeds
    up your system's performance. If you do not specify an InitCacheSize
    value, SMARTDrive sets the value according to how much memory your
    system has (see the table below).
 
WinCacheSize
    Specifies, in kilobytes, how much SMARTDrive will reduce the cache size
    for Windows. When you start Windows, SMARTDrive reduces the size of the
    cache to recover memory for Windows' use. When you quit Windows, the
    cache returns to its normal size. WinCacheSize specifies the smallest
    size to which SMARTDrive will reduce the cache. The default value
    depends on how much available memory your system has (see the table
    below). If you specify a value for InitCacheSize that is smaller than
    the value specified for WinCacheSize, InitCacheSize is set to the same
    size as WinCacheSize.
 
The following table shows what the default values for InitCacheSize and
WinCacheSize will be, depending on the amount of available extended memory
your computer has.

Switches
 
/X
    Disables write-behind caching for all drives. You can then enable
    caching for individual drives by using the drive+|- parameter.
 
/U
    Does not load the CD-ROM caching module of SMARTDrive even if you have a
    CD-ROM drive. If SMARTDrive is loaded with the /U switch, you cannot
    enable CD-ROM drive caching. If SMARTDrive is loaded without the /U
    switch, you can disable or enable caching individual CD-ROM drives using
    the drive+|- parameter.
 
/C
    Writes all cached information from memory to cached disks. SMARTDrive
    writes information from memory to the disk at times when other disk
    activity has slowed. You might use this option if you are going to turn
    off your computer and want to make sure all cached information has been
    written to the disk. (SMARTDrive writes all cached information to the
    disk if you restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE, but not
    if you simply turn off the power or press your computer's reset
    button.)
 
/R
    Clears the contents of the existing cache, including writing all
    write-cached information to disk, and restarts SMARTDrive.
 
/F
    Writes cached data after each command completes. This is the default
    value.
 
/N
    Writes cached data when the system is idle. When the command prompt
    returns, not all cached data may be written yet. To ensure that all the
    cached data is written, use the /C switch.
 
/L
    Prevents SMARTDrive from automatically loading into upper memory blocks
    (UMBs), even if there are UMBs available. You can use the /L switch if
    upper memory is enabled for use by programs. If you are using
    SMARTDrive's double-buffering feature and your system appears to be
    running slowly, try adding the /L switch to the SMARTDrive command in
    your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
 
/V
    Instructs SMARTDrive to display status and error messages when it
    starts. (By default, SMARTDrive does not display any messages unless it
    encounters an error condition.) The /V switch cannot be used in
    conjunction with the /Q switch.
 
/Q
    Instructs SMARTDrive not to display status messages when it starts. (By
    default, SMARTDrive does not display status messages when loading, but
    does for most other operations.) If SMARTDrive encounters an error while
    starting, it displays an error message whether or not it was loaded with
    the /Q switch. The /Q switch cannot be used in conjunction with the /V
    switch.
 
/S
    Displays additional information about the status of SMARTDrive.
 
/E:ElementSize
    Specifies in bytes the amount of the cache that SMARTDrive moves at a
    time. Valid values are 1024, 2048, 4096, and 8192. The default value is
    8192. The larger the value, the more conventional memory SMARTDrive
    uses.
 
/B:BufferSize
    Specifies in bytes the size of the read-ahead buffer. A read-ahead
    buffer is additional information that SMARTDrive reads when an
    application reads information from the hard disk. For example, if an
    application reads 512K of information from a file, SMARTDrive then reads
    the amount of information specified by BufferSize and saves it in
    memory. The next time the application needs to read information from
    that file, it can read it from memory instead. The default size of the
    read-ahead buffer is 16K (16384 bytes). Its value can be any multiple of
    ElementSize. The larger the value of BufferSize, the more conventional
    memory SMARTDrive uses.
 
Caution:  Check that SMARTDrive has completed all write-caching before you
          restart  or turn off your computer. (This is not necessary if you
          restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE.) To have
          SMARTDrive write all cached information to cached disks, type
          SMARTDRV /C at the command prompt. After all disk activity has
          stopped, you can safely restart or turn off your computer.

                              SMARTDRVฤฤNotes
 
Enabling write caching on specific drives
 
By default, MS-DOS Setup configures SMARTDrive so that write-caching is
disabled. This configuration is extremely safe, but does not provide optimum
speed. After SMARTDrive starts, you can use the SMARTDRV command to enable
write caching on specific drives. This can significantly speed up your
system. To enable write-caching on a particular drive, carry out the
SMARTDRV command and specify the drive letter and a plus sign. For example,
to enable write-caching on drive C, you would type the following:
 
    smartdrv c+
 
For information about enabling write-caching for compressed drives, see
"SMARTDrive and Compressed Drives" later in this help topic.
 
Using extended memory
 
For SMARTDrive to use extended memory, your CONFIG.SYS file must contain a
DEVICE command for HIMEM.SYS or another extended-memory manager that
conforms to the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft/AST eXtended Memory Specification
(XMS).
 
Loading SMARTDrive into the upper memory area
 
If the upper memory area is available through MS-DOS, SMARTDrive will
automatically load into upper memory. You do not need to use the LOADHIGH
command with SMARTDrive.
 
If your hard disk requires double buffering, SMARTDrive may run faster if
its cache is located in conventional memory. To load SMARTDrive into upper
memory and its cache in conventional memory, use the following command:
 
    loadhigh smartdrv /l
 
SMARTDrive and compressed drives
 
SMARTDrive does not actually cache compressed drives; instead, it caches the
physical (host) drive on which the compressed volume file is located. This
improves the speed of both the physical drive and the compressed drive.
 
SMARTDrive and CD-ROM drives
 
If you are using a CD-ROM drive and you want to cache it, load MSCDEX before
you load SMARTDrive. If you do not want to cache the CD-ROM drive, load
SMARTDrive with the /U switch. (Note that MS-DOS Setup adds the SMARTDRV
command to the beginning of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, before any other
commands.)
 
To find out whether SMARTDrive is caching your CD-ROM drive, type SMARTDRV
at the command prompt.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                             SMARTDRVฤฤExamples
 
To create a SMARTDrive disk cache and use the default cache size, add the
following command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
 
    c:\dos\smartdrv
 
Example: A typical SMARTDrive command
 
Suppose you want to create a disk cache with a cache size of 2048K, and
ensure that Windows will not reduce the size of the cache to less than
1024K. To do this and to specify that the SMARTDRV.EXE file is located in
the DOS directory on drive C, add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file:
 
    c:\dos\smartdrv 2048 1024
 
Example: Enabling and disabling caching on specific drives
 
Suppose that SMARTDrive is already running and you want to enable write
caching on drive C. To do this, type the following at the command prompt:
 
    smartdrv c+
 
Suppose you want to configure SMARTDrive to disable all caching of your
floppy-disk drives and enable write caching on Interlnk drive D. (Interlnk
drives, like floppy-disk drives, are not write-cached by default because
it's possible to lose access to the drive before all information has been
written from the cache). To do this, you would add the following command to
your AUTOEXEC.BAT:
 
    c:\dos\smartdrv a- b- d+
 
Example: Saving cached information on the hard disk
 
Before pressing your computer's reset button or turning off your computer,
it is a good idea to have SMARTDrive write all cached information from
memory to any cached disks. To do this, type the following at the command
prompt:
 
    smartdrv /c
 
You will not need to use this command before restarting your computer by
pressing the CTRL+ALT+DELETE keys: SMARTDrive detects the CTRL+ALT+DELETE
key sequence and automatically writes all information to cached disks before
allowing the system to restart.

                       SMARTDRV.EXEฤฤDouble Buffering
 
Loads the SMARTDRV.EXE device driver to perform double buffering. Double
buffering provides compatibility for certain hard-disk controllers that
cannot work with memory provided by EMM386 or Windows running in 386
enhanced mode. To find out whether you need to use double buffering, see
<SMARTDRV.EXEฤฤNotes>.
 
SMARTDrive can also perform disk caching, which can speed up your computer.
To use SMARTDrive for disk caching, add the <SMARTDRV> command to your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
 
To use the double-buffering feature of SMARTDrive, the SMARTDRV.EXE device
driver must be loaded by a <DEVICE> command in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
Syntax
 
    DEVICE=[drive:][path]SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER
 
Parameters
 
[drive:][path]
    Specifies the location of the SMARTDRV.EXE file.
 
/DOUBLE_BUFFER
    Instructs SMARTDrive to perform double buffering.

                            SMARTDRV.EXEฤฤNotes
 
Double buffering and conventional memory
 
SMARTDrive's double-buffering component must be loaded in conventional
memory. It uses 2K of conventional memory, and cannot be loaded in upper
memory.
 
The SMARTDrive disk cache can use either upper memory or conventional
memory. For more information, see <SMARTDRVฤฤNotes>.
 
Determining whether you need to use double buffering
 
If you use EMM386 or run Windows in 386 enhanced mode, you may need to use
double buffering. Double buffering is most commonly required with an SCSI
(small computer system interface) hard disk or other device, but can also be
necessary with an ESDI (enhanced system device interface) or MCA
(microchannel architecture) device.
 
Most hard disks do not need to use double buffering. If you are not sure
whether your hard disk needs double buffering, follow these steps:
 
1  Add the following command to your CONFIG.SYS file if the file does not
   already contain such a command:
 
       device=c:\dos\smartdrv.exe /double_buffer
 
   This command must appear before the DEVICE command that starts EMM386, if
   any.
 
2  Add the following command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file if the file does not
   already contain such a command:
 
       c:\dos\smartdrv
 
3  Run the MemMaker program if you haven't already done so.
 
4  Use the MEM /C /P command to confirm that upper memory is in use.
 
5  At the command prompt, type SMARTDRV and then press ENTER.
 
   SMARTDrive displays information about your system.
 
6  Look at the column labeled "Buffering." If any line in this column reads
   "yes," you need to run the double-buffering component of SMARTDrive. (If
   your system seems to be running slowly, try adding the /L switch to the
   SMARTDRV command in AUTOEXEC.BAT.)
 
   If every line in the "Buffering" column says "no," you can remove the
   DEVICE command for SMARTDRV.EXE from your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
   If any line in the "Buffering" column contains the character "-", then
   SMARTDrive is unable to detect whether double buffering is needed. Use
   the MEM /C /P command to confirm that programs are located in upper
   memory.

                           SMARTDRV.EXEฤฤExample
 
Suppose you need to use SMARTDrive's double-buffering feature so that you
can use EMM386 to gain access to the upper memory area. To enable double
buffering, you would add the following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    device=c:\dos\smartdrv.exe /double_buffer
 
To improve your computer's speed, you could also install the SMARTDrive disk
cache by adding the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
 
    c:\dos\smartdrv /l

                                    SORT
 
Reads input, sorts data, and writes the results to the screen, a file, or
another device.
 
SORT acts as a filter, reading characters in a specified column and
rearranging them in ascending or descending order.
 
Syntax
 
    SORT [/R] [/+n] [<] [drive1:][path1]filename1
    [> [drive2:][path2]filename2]
 
    [command |] SORT [/R] [/+n] [> [drive2:][path2]filename2]
 
Parameters
 
[drive1:][path1]filename1
    Specifies the location and name of the file whose data you want to
    sort.
 
[drive2:][path2]filename2
    Specifies the location and name of a file in which the sorted output is
    to be stored.
 
command
    Specifies a command whose output is the data you want to sort.
 
Switches
 
/R
    Reverses the order of the sorting operation; that is, sorts from Z to A,
    and then from 9 to 0.
 
/+n
    Sorts the file according to the character in column n. If you do not use
    this switch, the SORT command sorts data according to the characters in
    column 1.
 
Related Command
 
For information about displaying information one screen at a time, see the
<MORE> command.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                SORTฤฤNotes
 
Specifying a source
 
Unless you specify the command or filename parameter, SORT acts as a filter
and takes input from the MS-DOS standard input (usually from the keyboard,
from a pipe, or from a file).
 
Using redirection symbols with SORT
 
You can use the pipe (|) or the less-than sign (<) to direct data through
the SORT command from command or filename. If you want to display the
information one screen at a time or direct the information to a file, you
can also specify the MORE command or a filename. You can use the
greater-than sign (>) to direct the sorted output to a file.
 
Before using a pipe for redirection, you should set the TEMP environment
variable in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
 
Collating sequence
 
The SORT program uses the collating-sequence table corresponding to the
country code and code-page settings. Characters greater than ASCII code 127
are sorted based on information in the COUNTRY.SYS file or in an alternate
file specified by the COUNTRY command in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
Uppercase vs. lowercase
 
SORT does not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters.
 
Limits on file size
 
The SORT command can handle files as large as 64K.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                               SORTฤฤExamples
 
The following command reads the file EXPENSES.TXT, sorts it in reverse
order, and displays it on your screen:
 
    sort /r < expenses.txt
 
Suppose you want to search a large file named MAILLST.TXT for the text
"Jones", and suppose you want to sort the results of the search. To do this,
use the pipe (|) to direct the output of a FIND command to the SORT command,
as shown in the following example:
 
    find "jones" maillst.txt | sort
 
The command produces a sorted list of lines that contain the specified
text.
 
To sort keyboard input and display the results alphabetically on the screen,
you can first use the SORT command with no parameters, as the following
example shows:
 
    SORT
 
Then type the text you want sorted, pressing ENTER at the end of each line.
When you have finished typing text, press CTRL+Z, and then press ENTER. The
SORT command displays the text you typed, sorted alphabetically. You could
also redirect sorted keyboard input to a file.

                                   STACKS
 
Supports the dynamic use of data stacks to handle hardware interrupts. You
can use this command only in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
Syntax
 
    STACKS=n,s
 
Parameters
 
n
    Specifies the number of stacks. Valid values for n are 0 and numbers in
    the range 8 through 64.
 
s
    Specifies the size (in bytes) of each stack. Valid values for s are 0
    and numbers in the range 32 through 512.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                               STACKSฤฤNotes
 
Default settings
 
The default settings for the STACKS command are as follows:
 
Computer                              Stacks
 
ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ
 
IBM PC, IBM PC/XT, IBM PC-Portable      0,0
 
Other                                  9,128
 
Special cases for stack allocation
 
Upon receiving a hardware interrupt, MS-DOS allocates one stack from the
specified number of stacks. When you specify 0 for the n and s values,
MS-DOS allocates no stacks. If the values are 0, each running program must
have enough stack space to accommodate the computer's hardware interrupt
drivers. Many computers operate correctly, saving some memory for programs,
with n and s values of 0. If, however, your computer becomes unstable when
you set these values to 0, return to the default values.
 
Increasing the value of STACKS
 
If the STACKS values are not equal to 0,0 and you see a "Stack Overflow" or
"Exception error 12" message, increase the number or size of the stacks.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                              STACKSฤฤExample
 
To allocate 8 stacks of 512 bytes each for hardware-interrupt handling, add
the following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    stacks=8,512
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                  SUBMENU
 
Defines an item on a startup menu that, when selected, displays another set
of choices. You can use this command only within a menu block in your
CONFIG.SYS file.
 
The startup menu is a list of choices that appears when you start your
computer. You define a startup menu by using special CONFIG.SYS commands.
Each item on the menu corresponds to a set of CONFIG.SYS commands called a
"configuration block." A startup menu makes it possible to start your
computer with a variety of configurations. For more information about
defining multiple configurations, see the chapter "Configuring Your System"
in the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
Syntax
 
    SUBMENU=blockname[,menu_text]
 
Parameters
 
blockname
    Specifies the name of the associated menu block. The menu block must be
    defined elsewhere in the CONFIG.SYS file and can contain menu-definition
    commands. Unlike the "main" menu block, which must have the block name
    [MENU], a menu block for a submenu can have any name you want. If MS-DOS
    cannot find a block with the specified name, the item does not appear on
    the startup menu. The block name can be up to 70 characters long and can
    contain most printable characters. It cannot include spaces, backslashes
    (\) and forward slashes (/), commas, semicolons (;), equal signs (=),
    and square brackets ([ and ]).
 
menu_text
    Specifies the text you want MS-DOS to display for this menu item. If you
    don't specify any menu text, MS-DOS displays the block name as the menu
    item. The menu text can be up to 70 characters long and can contain any
    characters you want.
 
Related Commands
 
The SUBMENU command is one of six special CONFIG.SYS commands for defining
startup menus. The other commands are:
 
  The <MENUITEM> command, which defines an item on the menu.
 
  The <MENUDEFAULT> command, which specifies the default menu item.
 
  The <MENUCOLOR> command, which defines the color of the menu's text and
   screen background.
 
  The <NUMLOCK> command, which specifies the state of the NUM LOCK key when
   the startup menu appears. (Although NUMLOCK can be used anywhere in the
   CONFIG.SYS file, it is especially useful when defining a startup menu.)
 
  The <INCLUDE> command, which includes the contents of one configuration
   block in another. This command cannot be included in a menu block.
 
For an overview of the steps required to define multiple configurations, see
<Commands for Defining Multiple Configurations>.

                              SUBMENUฤฤExample
 
The following CONFIG.SYS file defines a main startup menu and one submenu:
 
    [menu]
    menuitem base_config,Base configuration only
    menuitem full_config,Normal configuration
    submenu netmenu, Normal configuration with network
 
    [netmenu]
    menuitem lanman, Start Microsoft LAN Manager
    menuitem vines, Start Banyan VINES
 
    [base_config]
    dos=high
    device=c:\dos\himem
 
    [full_config]
    include=base_config
    dos=umb
    device=c:\dos\emm386 ram
    device=c:\dos\ramdrive.sys 512
 
    [lanman]
    include=full_config
    rem Commands for Microsoft LAN Manager would go here.
 
    [vines]
    include=full_config
    rem Commands for Banyan VINES would go here
 
This CONFIG.SYS file provides a choice of four configurations: a basic
configuration (base_config), a full configuration (full_config), and two
network configurations. Both network configurations include all the commands
in the full configuration; the lanman configuration runs Microsoft LAN
Manager and the vines configuration runs Banyan VINES network software. To
choose a network configuration, the user first selects item 3, "Normal
configuration with network," from the main menu. MS-DOS then displays the
network choices on the submenu.
 
When MS-DOS starts, it displays the following menu:
 
    MS-DOS 6 Startup Menu
    =====================
 
       1. Base configuration only
       2. Normal configuration
       3. Normal configuration with network
 
    Enter a choice: 1
 
If item 3 is selected, MS-DOS displays the following menu instead:
 
    MS-DOS 6 Startup Menu
    =====================
 
    1. Start Microsoft LAN Manager
    2. Start Banyan VINES
 
    Enter a choice: 1

                                   SUBST
 
Associates a path with a drive letter.
 
The drive letter you assign represents a virtual drive, because you can use
the drive letter in commands as if it were a physical drive.
 
Do not use the SUBST command when Windows is running.
 
Syntax
 
    SUBST [drive1: [drive2:]path]
 
    SUBST drive1: /D
 
To display the names of the virtual drives in effect, use the following
syntax:
 
    SUBST
 
Parameters
 
drive1:

Using other commands with SUBST
 
The following commands do not work, or should not be used, on drives used in
the SUBST command:
 
ASSIGN           DISKCOPY          RECOVER
BACKUP           FDISK             RESTORE
CHKDSK           FORMAT            SYS
DEFRAG           LABEL             UNDELETE /S
DISKCOMP         MIRROR
 
Valid drive1 values
 
The drive1 parameter must be within the range specified by the LASTDRIVE
command. If not, SUBST displays the following error message:
 
    Invalid parameter - drive1:
 
Using SUBST with Microsoft Windows
 
Do not create or delete virtual drives using the SUBST command while
Microsoft Windows is running. If you want to create or delete a virtual
drive using the SUBST command, quit Windows, create or delete the virtual
drive, and then start Windows again.
 
Using SUBST with compressed drives
 
You can use SUBST to associate a path on a compressed drive with a drive
letter. However, the drive size and free space of the SUBST drive (for
example, as reported by the DIR command) might not match the drive size and
free space reported for the compressed drive.

                               SUBSTฤฤExample
 
The following command creates a virtual drive Z for the path
B:\USER\BETTY\FORMS:
 
    subst z: b:\user\betty\forms
 
Now, instead of typing the full path, you can reach this directory by typing
the letter of the virtual drive, followed by a colon, as in the following
example:
 
    z:
 
This example works only if you have included the line LASTDRIVE=Z in your
CONFIG.SYS file to define Z as the highest letter that MS-DOS recognizes as
a disk drive. For more information, see the <LASTDRIVE> command.

                                  SWITCHES
 
Specifies special options in MS-DOS. Use this command only in your
CONFIG.SYS file.
 
Syntax
 
    SWITCHES= /F /K /N /W
 
Switches
 
/F
    Skips the 2-second delay after displaying the "Starting MS-DOS ..."
    message during startup.
 
/K
    Forces an enhanced keyboard to behave like a conventional keyboard.
 
/N
    Prevents you from using the F5 or F8 key to bypass startup commands.
    (SWITCHES /N does not prevent you from pressing CTRL+F5 or CTRL+F8 to
    bypass DBLSPACE.BIN; to prevent this, use the <DBLSPACE /SWITCHES>
    command to add the SWITCHES /N setting to your DBLSPACE.INI file.)
 
/W
    Specifies that the WINA20.386 file has been moved to a directory other
    than the root directory. You need to use this switch only if you are
    using Microsoft Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode and have moved the
    WINA20.386 file from the root directory to another directory.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                              SWITCHESฤฤNotes
 
When to use the SWITCHES command with an enhanced keyboard
 
If you have a program that does not correctly interpret input from an
enhanced keyboard, add this command to your CONFIG.SYS file so your enhanced
keyboard will use conventional keyboard functions.
 
Using the /K switch with ANSI.SYS
 
If you use the SWITCHES=/K command and you install the ANSI.SYS device
driver, use the /K switch on the DEVICE command line for ANSI.SYS.
 
The SWITCHES command and the DBLSPACE /SWITCHES command
 
The SWITCHES /N and SWITCHES /F commands affect the behavior of the F5 and
F8 keys when your computer starts. To control the behavior of the CTRL+F5
and CTRL+F8 startup keys, which bypass DoubleSpace in addition to other
startup commands, use the <DBLSPACE /SWITCHES>command.
 
Using the SWITCHES command with Microsoft Windows 3.0
 
In order for Microsoft Windows 3.0 to run in enhanced mode, the WINA20.386
file must be located in your root directory. If this file is not present,
you will see this message:
 
    You must have the file WINA20.386 in the root of your boot drive
    to run Windows in Enhanced Mode
 
If you move the WINA20.386 file, you must add the SWITCHES command with the
/W switch to your CONFIG.SYS file. You must also add a DEVICE command under
the [386Enh] heading in your SYSTEM.INI file, specifying the new location of
the WINA20.386 file.
 
If you do not use Microsoft Windows version 3.0, do not use the SWITCHES
command with the /W switch.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                             SWITCHESฤฤExamples
 
If you want MS-DOS to use conventional keyboard functions even though you
are using an enhanced keyboard, add the following command to your CONFIG.SYS
file:
 
    switches=/k
 
If you use Microsoft Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode and you have moved the
WINA20.386 file to a directory other than the root directory, add the
following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    switches=/w
 
If you want to prevent users from using the F5 or F8 key to bypass startup
commands, add the following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    switches=/n
 
If you want to skip the 2-second delay after displaying the "Starting MS-DOS
..." message during startup, add the following command to your CONFIG.SYS
file:
 
    switches=/f
 
You can also combine switches in one command. For example, if you want to
skip the 2-second delay after displaying the "Starting MS-DOS ..." message
during startup, and you use Microsoft Windows 3.0 and have moved the
WINA20.386 file to a directory other than the root directory, add the
following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    switches=/f /w

                                    SYS
 
Creates a startup disk by copying hidden MS-DOS system files (IO.SYS and
MSDOS.SYS), the MS-DOS command interpreter (COMMAND.COM), and the part of
MS-DOS that provides access to compressed drives (DBLSPACE.BIN) to the
disk.
 
IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS and DBLSPACE.BIN are hidden files and do not typically
appear when you type the DIR command. To see these files, type DIR /A.
 
Syntax
 
    SYS [drive1:][path] drive2:
 
Parameters
 
[drive1:][path]
    Specifies the location of the system files. If you do not specify a
    path, MS-DOS searches the root directory on the current drive for the
    system files.
 
drive2:
    Specifies the drive to which you want to copy the system files. These
    files can be copied only to a root directory, not to a subdirectory.

                                 SYSฤฤNotes
 
How the SYS command copies files
 
The SYS command copies the files in the following order: IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS,
COMMAND.COM and DBLSPACE.BIN.
 
No requirement for contiguous files
 
MS-DOS no longer requires the two system files to be contiguous. This means
that when you want to copy a new version of MS-DOS to a disk containing
system files for MS-DOS version 3.3 or earlier, you need not reformat the
disk.
 
Using the SYS command on compressed drives
 
The SYS command does not work on compressed drives. If drive C is compressed
and you need to make your hard disk bootable, use the SYS command on drive
C's host drive. (To find out which is drive C's host drive, type DBLSPACE
/INFO C: at the command prompt.)
 
qhmark 574 Using the SYS command on assigned drives and network drives
 
The SYS command does not work on drives that have been redirected by using
the ASSIGN, JOIN, or SUBST command. SYS also does not work on network drives
or drives redirected using INTERLNK.

                                    TIME
 
Displays the system time or sets your computer's internal clock.
 
MS-DOS uses time information to update the directory whenever you create or
change a file.
 
Syntax
 
    TIME [hours:[minutes[:seconds[.hundredths]]][A|P]]
 
To display the current time or to display a prompt by which you can change
the current time, use the following syntax:
 
    TIME
 
Parameters
 
hours
    Specifies the hour. Valid values are in the range 0 through 23.
 
minutes
    Specifies minutes. Valid values are in the range 0 through 59.
 
seconds
    Specifies seconds. Valid values are in the range 0 through 59.
 
hundredths
    Specifies hundredths of a second. Valid values are in the range 0
    through 99.
 
A|P
    Specifies A.M or P.M. for the 12-hour time format. If you type a valid
    12-hour time but do not type A or P, TIME uses A (for A.M.).

                                TIMEฤฤNotes
 
Specifying an invalid TIME format
 
If you specify the time in an invalid format, MS-DOS displays the following
message and then waits for you to specify the time:
 
    Invalid time
    Enter new time:_
 
Changing the TIME format
 
You can change the TIME format by changing the COUNTRY setting in your
CONFIG.SYS file. For more information, see the <COUNTRY> command. Depending
on the country code, MS-DOS will display the time in the 12-hour format or
the 24-hour format. If you are setting the time in the 12-hour format, be
sure to specify P for hours after noon.
 
Ensuring that MS-DOS prompts you for the time
 
If you want MS-DOS to prompt you for the current time whenever you start
your system, you can add the TIME command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. MS-DOS
will automatically prompt you for the time and date if you do not have an
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Parameters
 
drive:
    Specifies the drive that contains the disk for which you want to display
    the directory structure.
 
path
    Specifies the directory for which you want to display the directory
    structure.
 
Switches
 
/F
    Displays the names of the files in each directory.

                                  UNDELETE
 
Restores files that were previously deleted by using the <DEL> command.
 
UNDELETE offers three levels of protecting files against accidental
deletionฤฤ Delete Sentry, Delete Tracker, and standard. For information
about each level of protection, see Notes.
 
For information about the Windows version of UNDELETE, see the chapter
"Managing Your System" in the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide, or see Windows Undelete
Help.
 
Syntax
 
    UNDELETE [[drive:][path]filename] [/DT|/DS|/DOS]
 
    UNDELETE [/LIST|/ALL|/PURGE[drive]|/STATUS|/LOAD|/UNLOAD
    |/S[drive]|/Tdrive[-entries]]
 
Parameter
 
[drive:][path]filename
    Specifies the location and name of the file or set of files you want to
    recover. By default, UNDELETE restores all deleted files in the current
    directory.
 
Switches
 
/LIST
    Lists the deleted files that are available to be recovered, but does not
    recover any files. The [drive:][path]filename parameter and the /DT,
    /DS, and /DOS switches control the listing produced by this switch.
 
/ALL
    Recovers deleted files without prompting for confirmation on each file.
    UNDELETE uses the Delete Sentry method, if it is present. If Delete
    Sentry is not, UNDELETE uses Delete Tracker, if present. Otherwise,
    UNDELETE recovers files from the DOS directory, supplying a number sign
    (#) for the missing first character in the filename. If a duplicate
    filename already exists, this switch next tries each of the following
    characters, in the order listed, until the result is a unique filename:
    #%&0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.
 
/DOS
    Recovers only those files that are internally listed as deleted by
    MS-DOS, prompting for confirmation on each file. If a deletion-tracking
    file exists, this switch causes UNDELETE to ignore it.
 
/DT
    Recovers only those files listed in the deletion-tracking file,
    prompting for confirmation on each file.
 
/DS
    Recovers only those files listed in the SENTRY directory, prompting for
    confirmation on each file.
 
/LOAD
    Loads the Undelete memory-resident program into memory using information
    defined in the UNDELETE.INI file. If the UNDELETE.INI file does not
    exist, UNDELETE uses default values.
 
/UNLOAD
    Unloads the memory-resident portion of the Undelete program from memory,
    turning off the capability to restore deleted files.
 
/PURGE[drive]
    Deletes the contents of the SENTRY directory. If no drive is specified,
    UNDELETE searches the current drive for the directory.
 
/STATUS
    Displays the type of delete protection in effect for each drive.
 
/S[drive]
    Enables the Delete Sentry level of protection and loads the
    memory-resident portion of the UNDELETE program. The program records
    information used to recover deleted files on the specified drive. If you
    do not specify a drive, using this switch enables the Delete Sentry
    level of protection on the current drive. Specifying the /S switch loads
    the memory-resident program into memory using the information defined in
    the UNDELETE.INI file.
 
/Tdrive[-entries]
    Enables the Delete Tracker level of protection and loads the
    memory-resident portion of the UNDELETE program. The program records
    information used to recover deleted files. The required drive parameter
    specifies the drive containing the disk for which you want UNDELETE to
    save information about deleted files. The optional entries parameter,
    which must be a value in the range 1 through 999, specifies the maximum
    number of entries in the deletion-tracking file (PCTRACKR.DEL). The
    default value for entries depends upon the type of disk being tracked.
    The following list shows each disk size, its default number of entries,
    and its corresponding file size:

                              UNDELETEฤฤNotes
 
CAUTION:  Once you delete a file from your disk, you may not be able
          retrieve it. Although the UNDELETE command can recover deleted
          files, it can do so with certainty only if no other files have
          been created or changed on the disk. If you accidentally delete a
          file that you want to keep, stop what you are doing and
          immediately use the UNDELETE command to retrieve the file.
 
Levels of protection
 
MS-DOS provides three levels of protection against accidental file
deletionฤฤDelete Sentry, Delete Tracker, and standard.
 
Delete Sentry provides the highest level of protection. Delete Sentry
requires a small amount of memory and disk space. The next level of
protection is Delete Tracker, which requires the same amount of memory as
Delete Sentry, but minimal disk space. The lowest level of protection,
standard, requires neither memory nor disk space, but still allows you to
recover deleted files, provided that their location on the disk has not been
taken by other files.
 
For more details, see the notes that follow about each level of protection.
 
Delete Sentry
 
Delete Sentry provides the highest level of protection to ensure that you
can recover deleted files. This level of protection creates a hidden
directory named SENTRY. When you delete a file, UNDELETE moves the file from
its current location to the SENTRY directory without changing the record of
the file's location in the file allocation table (FAT). If you undelete the
file, MS-DOS moves the file back to its original location.
 
The size of the SENTRY directory and its files is limited to approximately 7
percent of your hard disk space. If you delete a file and the directory and
its files exceed this limit, UNDELETE purges the oldest files until enough
space has been freed to accommodate the newly deleted file.
 
In addition to the disk space needed for the SENTRY directory, Delete Sentry
requires 13.5K of memory for the memory-resident portion of the UNDELETE
program.
 
Delete Tracker
 
Delete Tracker provides an intermediate level of protection. It uses a
hidden file named PCTRACKER.DEL to record the location of deleted files.
When you delete a file, MS-DOS changes the file allocation table (FAT) to
indicate that the location of the file is now available for another file.
You can recover the deleted file provided that another file has not been
placed in that location. If another file has been placed there, you may be
able to partially recover the deleted file.
 
Delete Tracker requires 13.5K of memory for the memory-resident portion of
the UNDELETE program and a minimal amount of disk space for the
PCTRACKER.DEL file.
 
Standard
 
The standard level of protection is automatically available when you switch
on your computer. Of the three levels of guarding against accidental file
deletion, it provides the lowest level of protection. However, it does not
require you to load a memory-resident program. It also has the advantage of
requiring neither memory nor disk space.
 
Using this level of protection, you can recover a deleted file, provided
MS-DOS has not placed another file in the deleted file's location. If a file
has been placed there, you may be unable to recover all or part of the
deleted file.
 
Method used to recover files
 
Use any one of the following switches: /DOS, /DT, or /DS. If you do not
specify a switch, UNDELETE uses Delete Sentry, if it is available. If Delete
Sentry is not available, UNDELETE uses the Delete Tracker file, if
available. If a deletion-tracking file is not available, UNDELETE attempts
to recover files by using MS-DOS.
 
CAUTION:  UNDELETE cannot restore a directory that has been removed, and it
          cannot retrieve a file if you have removed the directory that
          contained the file. If the directory was an immediate subdirectory
          of the root directory, you may be able to retrieve the directory
          and its files if you first use the UNFORMAT command to restore the
          directory and then use UNDELETE to retrieve the files. You must
          use caution because you can lose data if you use UNFORMAT
          incorrectly. Usually, UNFORMAT can restore only immediate
          subdirectories of the root directory. However, when you use
          UNFORMAT to recover an accidentally formatted disk, UNFORMAT
          recovers all root-level files and subdirectory names.
 
The UNDELETE.INI file
 
UNDELETE uses the UNDELETE.INI file to define values when UNDELETE is loaded
into memory. If the file does not exist when you load UNDELETE into memory,
UNDELETE creates an UNDELETE.INI file that contains the following values:
 
  Use the Delete Sentry method of file tracking on the current drive.
 
  Save all files except *.TMP, *.VM?, *.WOA, *.SWP, *.SPL, *.RMG, *.IMG,
   *.THM, and *.DOV files.
 
  Do not save files that have the archive bit set.
 
  Purge files after 7 days.
 
  Restrict the amount of disk space available for deleted files to 20
   percent of total disk space.
 
The UNDELETE.INI file has five sections: [sentry.drives], [sentry.files],
[mirror.drives], [configuration], and [defaults].
 
The [sentry.drives] section specifies the drives protected by the Delete
Sentry method, if used.
 
The [sentry.files] section specifies the files protected from deletion using
either Delete Tracker or Delete Sentry. A hypen (-) before a filename
indicates that the file is not saved. The default values defined in the
[sentry.files] section are as follows:
 
    [sentry.files]
    *.* -*.TMP -*.VM? -*.WOA -*.SWP -*.SPL  -*.RMG -*.IMG -*.THM -*.DOV
 
The [mirror.drives] section specifies the drives protected by the Delete
Tracker method, if used.
 
The [configuration] section defines the following values:
 
  Whether files with the archive bit set are protected. If files with the
   archive bit set are not protected (the default value), the entry is as
   follows:
 
       archive=FALSE
 
   A TRUE value saves files with the archive bit set.
 
  The number of days files are saved. The following entry defines the
   default value:
 
       days=7
 
  The amount of total disk space reserved for deleted files. The following
   entry defines the default value:
 
       percentage=20
 
The [defaults] section specifies the method of file tracking. The following
defines the default Delete Sentry method:
 
    [defaults]
    d.sentry=TRUE
    d.tracker=FALSE
 
Changing the method of file protection
 
You can use only one method of file protection at a time. If you want to
change the method, carry out the following procedure:
 
1  Unload the memory-resident portion of the Undelete program by typing the
   following at the command prompt:
 
       undelete /u
 
2  Enable the new level of protection and reload the memory-resident portion
   of the Undelete program. For example, to enable the Delete Sentry level
   of protection on your current drive, type the following at the command
   prompt:
 
       undelete /s
 
Drives protected
 
The Undelete program protects all drives specified in the UNDELETE.INI file,
regardless of the drives you specify when you start the program. For
example, suppose your UNDELETE.INI file contains the following entry:
 
    [sentry.drives]
    C=
    D=
 
The following command enables the Delete Sentry level of protection on both
drives C and D:
 
    undelete /sc
 
To enable protection only on drive C, you would do the following:
 
1  Using any text editor, open your UNDELETE.INI file.
 
2  Delete the following line from the [sentry.drives] section of the file:
 
       D=
 
3  Save changes you made to the file.
 
4  Exit your text editor.
 
5  Enable Delete Sentry protection by typing the following at the command
   line:
 
       undelete /sc
 
Network drives and delete protection
 
To protect files on a network drive from accidental deletion, you must
enable the Delete Sentry level of protection and have read, write, create,
and delete file access in the drive's root directory.
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                             UNDELETEฤฤExamples
 
The following command specifies that UNDELETE is to recover all deleted
files in the current directory one at a time, to prompt for confirmation on
each file, and to use the highest available level of delete tracking:
 
    undelete
 
The following command specifies that UNDELETE is to recover all deleted
files with the .BAT extension in the root directory of drive C, without
prompting for confirmation on each file:
 
    undelete c:\*.bat /all
 
The following command loads the memory-resident portion of the UNDELETE
program into memory, creates a hidden directory named SENTRY, and specifies
that UNDELETE move files you delete on drive C to that directory:
 
    undelete /sc
 
The following command loads the memory-resident portion of the UNDELETE
program into memory and creates a PCTRACKER.DEL file to track up to 400
deleted files on drive C:
 
    undelete /tc-400
 
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
                                  UNFORMAT
 
Restores a disk that was erased by using the FORMAT command.
 
UNFORMAT restores only local hard disk drives and floppy disk drives; it
cannot be used on network drives. The UNFORMAT command can also rebuild a
corrupted disk partition table on a hard disk drive.
 
Syntax
 
    UNFORMAT drive: [/L] [/TEST] [/P]
 
Parameter
 
drive:
    Specifies the drive that contains the disk on which you want to recover
    files.
 
Switches
 
/L
    Lists every file and subdirectory found by UNFORMAT. If you do not
    specify this switch, UNFORMAT lists only subdirectories and files that
    are fragmented. To suspend scrolling of the displayed list, press
    CTRL+S; to resume scrolling, press any key.
 
/TEST
    Shows how UNFORMAT would recreate the information on the disk, but does
    not actually unformat the disk.
 
/P
    Sends output messages to the printer connected to LPT1.
 
Related Command
 
For information about formatting a disk, see the <FORMAT> command.

                              UNFORMATฤฤNotes
 
Limitation on the UNFORMAT command
 
If the FORMAT command was used with the /U switch, UNFORMAT cannot restore
the disk to its previous condition.
 
Unformatting a disk
 
The UNFORMAT command can restore your disk by using information in the root
directory and file allocation table on the disk.
 
As UNFORMAT rebuilds the disk, it displays how many subdirectories it has
found; if you specified the /L switch, it also shows you all files in each
subdirectory.
 
If UNFORMAT finds a file that appears to be fragmented (that is, stored in
separate places on the disk), it cannot recover the file because it cannot
locate the remaining portions of the file. In this case, the UNFORMAT
command prompts you to confirm whether you want UNFORMAT to truncate the
file (that is, recover only the first part of the file that it can locate)
or delete the file altogether.
 
If UNFORMAT does not prompt you for a specific file, that file is most
likely intact. In certain circumstances, however, UNFORMAT may not recognize
that a file is fragmented, even though it has located only a portion of the
file. If this happens to a program file, the program does not run properly.
If this happens to a data file, information is lost and the program that
created the data file may not be able to read it. In these cases, your only
recourse is to restore the files from your original floppy disks or backup
files.
 
Sector size of the hard disk
 
The sectors on your hard disk must be 512, 1024, or 2048 bytes.

                             UNFORMATฤฤExamples
 
To determine whether UNFORMAT can restore a formatted disk in drive A, type
the following command:
 
    unformat a: /test
 
To restore a formatted disk in drive A, listing all files and
subdirectories, type the following command:
 
    unformat a: /l

                                   VERIFY
 
Directs MS-DOS to verify that your files are written correctly to a disk and
displays the status of verification. For example, you can use this command
to make sure data is not written to a bad sector. You can use this command
either at the command prompt or in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
 
Syntax
 
    VERIFY [ON|OFF]
 
Switch
 
ON|OFF
    Specifies whether MS-DOS should verify (ON) or not verify (OFF) that
    write operations are done correctly.

                                   VSAFE
 
Continuously monitors your computer for viruses and displays a warning when
it finds one. VSAFE is a memory-resident program that uses 22K of memory.
 
Do not use the VSAFE command when Windows is running.
 
Syntax
    VSAFE [/option[+ | -] ...] [/NE] [/NX] [/Ax | /Cx] [/N] [/D] [/U]
 
Switches
 
option
    Specifies how VSAFE monitors for viruses. Use a plus or minus sign (+ or
    -) after the number to turn an option on or off. The following list
    describes the options you can choose.

                                   XCOPY
 
Copies directories, their subdirectories, and files (except hidden and
system files).
 
With this command, you can copy all the files in a directory, including the
files in the subdirectories of that directory.
 
Syntax
 
    XCOPY source [destination] [/Y|/-Y] [/A|/M] [/D:date] [/P] [/S] [/E]
    [/V] [/W]
 
Parameters
 
source
    Specifies the location and names of the files you want to copy. Source
    must include either a drive or a path.
 
destination
    Specifies the destination of the files you want to copy. Destination can
    include a drive letter and colon, a directory name, a filename, or a
    combination.
 
Switches
 
/Y
    Indicates that you want XCOPY to replace existing file(s) without
    prompting you for confirmation. By default, if you specify an existing
    file as the destination file, XCOPY will ask you if you want to
    overwrite the existing file. (Previous versions of MS-DOS would simply
    replace the existing file.) If the XCOPY command is part of a batch
    file, XCOPY will behave as in previous versions. Specifying this switch
    overrides all defaults and the current setting of the COPYCMD
    environment variable.
 
/-Y
    Indicates that you want XCOPY to prompt you for confirmation when
    replacing an existing file. Specifying this switch overrides all
    defaults and the current setting of the COPYCMD environment variable.
 
/A
    Copies only source files that have their archive file attributes set.
    This switch does not modify the archive file attribute of the source
    file. For information about how to set the archive file attribute, see
    the ATTRIB command.
 
/M
    Copies source files that have their archive file attributes set. Unlike
    the /A switch, the /M switch turns off archive file attributes in the
    files specified in source. For information about how to set the archive
    file attribute, see the <ATTRIB> command.
 
/D:date
    Copies only source files modified on or after the specified date. Note
    that the format of date depends on the COUNTRY setting you are using.
 
/P
    Prompts you to confirm whether you want to create each destination
    file.
 
/S
    Copies directories and subdirectories, unless they are empty. If you
    omit this switch, XCOPY works within a single directory.
 
/E
    Copies any subdirectories, even if they are empty.
 
/V
    Verifies each file as it is written to the destination file to make sure
    that the destination files are identical to the source files.
 
/W
    Displays the following message and waits for your response before
    starting to copy files:
 
    Press any key to begin copying file(s)
 
Related Command
 
For information about copying individual files, see the <COPY> command. For
information about copying disks, see the <DISKCOPY> command.

                                XCOPYฤฤNotes
 
Default value for destination
 
If you omit destination, the XCOPY command copies the files to the current
directory.
 
Specifying whether destination is a file or directory
 
If destination does not contain an existing directory and does not end with
a backslash (\), XCOPY prompts you with a message in the following format:
 
    Does destination specify a file name
    or directory name on the target
    (F = file, D = directory)?
 
Press F if you want the file(s) to be copied to a file. Press D if you want
the file(s) to be copied to a directory.
 
Setting the COPYCMD environment variable
 
You can set the COPYCMD environment variable to specify whether you want the
COPY, MOVE, and XCOPY commands to prompt you for confirmation before
overwriting a file in all cases, whether issued from the command prompt or
from a batch file.
 
To force the COPY, MOVE, and XCOPY commands to prompt you before overwriting
in all cases, set the COPYCMD environment variable /-Y. To force these
commands to overwrite in all cases without prompting you, set the COPYCMD
environment variable to /Y.
 
Typing any of these commands with the /Y or /-Y switch overrides all
defaults and the current setting of the COPYCMD environment variable.
 
XCOPY does not copy hidden and system files
 
In older versions of MS-DOS, XCOPY copied hidden and system files. This is
not the case in MS-DOS 6.2. To remove the hidden or system attribute from a
file, use the <ATTRIB> command.
 
XCOPY sets archive attribute for destination files
 
XCOPY creates files with the archive attribute set, whether or not this
attribute was set in the source file. For more information about file
attributes, see the ATTRIB command.
 
XCOPY vs. DISKCOPY
 
If you have a disk that contains files in subdirectories and you want to
copy it to a disk that has a different format, you should use the XCOPY
command instead of DISKCOPY. Since the DISKCOPY command copies disks track
by track, it requires that your source and destination disks have the same
format. XCOPY has no such requirement. In general, use XCOPY unless you need
a complete disk image copy. However, XCOPY will not copy hidden or system
files such as IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS. Therefore, use DISKCOPY to make copies
of system disks.
 
XCOPY exit codes
 
The following list shows each exit code and a brief description of its
meaning:
 
0
    Files were copied without error.
 
1
    No files were found to copy.
 
2
    The user pressed CTRL+C to terminate XCOPY.
 
4
    Initialization error occurred. There is not enough memory or disk space,
    or you entered an invalid drive name or invalid syntax on the command
    line.
 
5
    Disk write error occurred.
 
You can use the ERRORLEVEL parameter on the IF command line in a batch
program to process exit codes returned by XCOPY. For more information, see
the topic <XCOPYฤฤExamples>.

                              XCOPYฤฤExamples
 
The following example copies all the files and subdirectories (including any
empty subdirectories) from the disk in drive A to the disk in drive B:
 
    xcopy a: b: /s /e
 
The following example uses the /D: and /V switches:
 
    xcopy a: b: /d:01/18/93 /s /v
 
In this example, only files on the disk in drive A that were written on or
after 01/18/93 are copied to the disk in drive B. Once the files are written
to the disk in drive B, the XCOPY command compares the files on the two
disks to make sure they are the same.
 
You can create a batch program to perform XCOPY operations and use the batch
IF command to process the exit code in case an error occurs. For example,
the following batch program uses replaceable parameters for the XCOPY source
and destination parameters:
 
    @echo off
    rem COPYIT.BAT transfers all source
    rem files in all directories on the source
    rem drive (%1) to the destination drive (%2)
 
    xcopy %1 %2 /s /e
 
    if errorlevel 4 goto lowmemory
    if errorlevel 2 goto abort
    if errorlevel 0 goto exit
 
    :lowmemory
    echo Insufficient memory to copy files or
    echo invalid drive or command-line syntax.
    goto exit
 
    :abort
    echo You pressed CTRL+C to end the copy operation.
    goto exit
 
    :exit
 
To use this batch program to copy all files in the C:\PRGMCODE directory and
its subdirectories to drive B, type the following command:
 
    copyit c:\prgmcode b:
 
The command interpreter substitutes C:\PRGMCODE for %1 and B: for %2, then
uses XCOPY with the /E and /S switches. If XCOPY encounters an error, the
batch program reads the exit code and goes to the label indicated in the
appropriate IF ERRORLEVEL statement. MS-DOS displays the appropriate message
and exits from the batch program.

                         What's New in MS-DOS 6.2?
 
Welcome to Microsoft MS-DOS, the most widely used operating system for
personal computers. MS-DOS 6.2 improves on the safety and ease of use
provided by MS-DOS 6. The rest of this topic describes features new to
MS-DOS 6.2. For information about features included in both MS-DOS 6 and
MS-DOS 6.2, see the Welcome chapter of the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
Safety Features and Enhancements
 
  MS-DOS 6.2 includes ScanDisk, a new utility that detects, diagnoses, and
   repairs disk errors on uncompressed drives and DoubleSpace compressed
   drives. ScanDisk can repair file system errors (such as crosslinks and
   lost clusters) and physical disk errors. ScanDisk keeps a log of its
   repairs and enables you to undo any of the changes it made. DoubleSpace
   runs ScanDisk to check the reliability of your disk before it begins
   compression. You can also run ScanDisk yourself by typing SCANDISK at the
   command prompt. For more information, see <An Introduction to ScanDisk>.
 
  DoubleSpace includes DoubleGuard safety checking, which protects against
   data corruption by verifying data integrity before writing data to your
   disk. If DoubleGuard detects that the memory DoubleSpace is using has
   been corrupted by another program, it shuts down your computer
   immediately to minimize damage to your data.
 
   Although DoubleGuard is on by default, you can turn it off to save
   memory. To do this, use the <DBLSPACE /DOUBLEGUARD> command, or turn off
   the DoubleGuard option in the Options dialog (start DoubleSpace, and then
   choose Options from the Tools menu).
 
  The MS-DOS extended-memory manager, HIMEM, automatically tests your
   system's memory when you start your computer. This test can identify
   memory chips that are no longer reliable. (Unreliable memory can result
   in system instability or loss of data.) To turn off the memory test, add
   the /TESTMEM:OFF switch to the command that starts HIMEM. For more
   information, see <HIMEM.SYS>.
 
  Setup now configures SMARTDrive as a read-only cache by default. Even if
   write-caching is enabled, MS-DOS does not display the command prompt
   until SMARTDrive has written its cache to your disk. This prevents you
   from turning off your computer before the data in memory is saved.
 
  The <MOVE>, <COPY>, and <XCOPY> commands now ask you for confirmation
   before copying a file over another file that has the same name. (However,
   when issued from a batch file, these commands do not prompt for
   confirmation before overwriting a file.)
 
Ease-of-Use Features and Other Enhancements
 
  With MS-DOS 6.2, you can easily uncompress a DoubleSpace drive or even
   completely uninstall DoubleSpace from memory. For more information, see
   <DBLSPACE /UNCOMPRESS>.
 
  SMARTDrive now caches CD-ROM drives. (For this support to be enabled, the
   MSCDEX program must be loaded before SMARTDrive. To find out if
   SMARTDrive is caching your CD-ROM drive, type SMARTDRV at the command
   prompt. If SMARTDRV lists the drive letter for your CD-ROM drive, the
   drive is being cached. For more information, see <SMARTDRV>.
 
  DoubleSpace automatically mounts compressed floppy disks and other
   compressed removable media ฤฤ even when Windows is running. Although
   automounting is enabled by default, you can turn it off to save memory.
   To do this, use the <DBLSPACE /AUTOMOUNT> command, or turn off the
   Automount option in the Options dialog (start DoubleSpace, and then
   choose Options from the Tools menu).
 
  You can now bypass or carry out individual commands in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
   and other batch programs. (In MS-DOS 6, this capability was limited to
   your CONFIG.SYS file.) This feature makes it easier to isolate problems
   when you are troubleshooting problems in your system configuration or in
   batch programs.
 
   To step through the commands in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, press F8 when
   your computer starts. For more information, see "Bypassing CONFIG.SYS and
   AUTOEXEC.BAT Commands" in the <CONFIG.SYS Commands> topic. To step
   through other batch files, use the <COMMAND /Y> command.
 
  If you need to, you can bypass DoubleSpace when you start your computer.
   This makes troubleshooting easier and also temporarily frees memory for
   use by other applications. For more information, see "Bypassing
   DoubleSpace" in the <CONFIG.SYS Commands> topic.
 
  The <DISKCOPY> command now uses your hard disk as an interim storage
   area, which makes copying from one floppy disk to another faster and
   easier.
 
  Microsoft Defragmenter makes better use of your computer's extended
   memory, so it can now defragment much larger disks and disks containing
   many more files and directories. For more information on running
   Defragmenter, see the <DEFRAG> command.
 
  The output of the DIR, MEM, CHKDSK, and FORMAT commands is much easier to
   read, since it now includes thousands separators when displaying numbers
   greater than 999. For example, "1000000 bytes free" now reads "1,000,000
   bytes free."

                        An Introduction to ScanDisk
 
ScanDisk is a full-featured disk analysis and repair program. It is designed
to work on both uncompressed drives and DoubleSpace compressed drives.
 
Starting ScanDisk
 
To start ScanDisk, type the following command:
 
    scandisk
 
ScanDisk begins checking the current drive. If ScanDisk finds any problems,
it displays a dialog explaining the problem.
 
To check a specific drive, type the drive letter after the ScanDisk command.
For example, to check drive D, type the following command:
 
    scandisk d:
 
Running ScanDisk
 
If ScanDisk doesn't find any problems with your drive, you don't have to do
much. Just let it run, and when it completes, choose the Exit button at the
bottom of the screen by typing X or by clicking Exit with the mouse.
 
If ScanDisk finds a problem, it displays a Problem Found dialog that briefly
explains the problem and what will happen if you fix it. Most Problem Found
dialogs have a Fix It button, a Don't Fix It button, and a More Info button.
To have ScanDisk correct the problem, choose the Fix It button.
 
Using the More Info dialogs
 
Most ScanDisk screens and dialogs include a More Info button. This displays
another dialog with more information ฤฤ usually additional technical details
ฤฤ about the current screen. For some types of problems, the More Info
dialog lists the names of affected files.
 
ScanDisk and compressed drives
 
If you run ScanDisk on a mounted or unmounted compressed drive, it offers to
check the host (physical) drive first. In general, you should allow it to do
so, since an error on the host drive could cause problems with the
compressed drive.
 
Creating an Undo disk
 
If ScanDisk finds a problem and you choose Fix It, ScanDisk offers to create
an Undo floppy disk that you can later use to restore your disk to its
previous state. You can restore your disk's previous state only if you
haven't changed it since making repairs. Creating an Undo disk is easy ฤฤ
you just insert a blank, formatted floppy disk in drive A or drive B, and
then choose the Drive A or Drive B button in the dialog ScanDisk displays.
 
Customizing ScanDisk by using the SCANDISK.INI file
 
The SCANDISK.INI file contains settings that determine many aspects of
ScanDisk's behavior. Most of the settings determine how ScanDisk will behave
if you start it with the /CUSTOM switch. You can also use the settings in
SCANDISK.INI to control other aspects of ScanDisk's behavior; for example,
to prevent ScanDisk from prompting you for an Undo disk, just change the
Undo setting in SCANDISK.INI to "Never". For more information about
SCANDISK.INI, see the comments within the file.

                              DoubleSpace Tips
 
This topic provides tips for getting the most out of DoubleSpace, and also
answers some common questions about DoubleSpace. For additional information
about DoubleSpace, see the "Freeing Disk Space" chapter in the MS-DOS 6
User's Guide, or see the <DBLSPACE> command.
 
What does DoubleSpace do?
 
DoubleSpace is a disk-compression program. It stores more files in less
space by storing those files more efficiently. Most files are stored fairly
inefficiently ฤฤ somewhat like a sponge that has a lot of air holes in it.
When you squeeze a sponge, it becomes temporarily smaller; but when you let
go of it, the sponge returns to its original shape and size. When you
compress a drive, DoubleSpace "squeezes" the files on that drive until they
are as small as possible ฤฤ just like squeezing a sponge. A file stored on a
compressed drive stays "squeezed" until you use it. When the file is loaded
into memory, DoubleSpace uncompresses the file so that it returns to its
original size, just as a sponge does when you let go of it. When you're
finished using the file, DoubleSpace "squeezes" it again and stores it back
on the compressed drive.
 
When should I use DoubleSpace?
 
You should use DoubleSpace if you are running low on disk space and don't
want to invest in a larger hard disk drive. DoubleSpace can dramatically
increase your available disk space. However, because DoubleSpace uses at
least 33K of memory, it makes sense not to install DoubleSpace unless you
need it.
 
How does DoubleSpace "squeeze" a file?
 
Most files contain a lot of repeated data. When DoubleSpace finds repeated
data in a file, it retains the first occurrence of that data, and replaces
any other occurrences of that data with a cross-reference to the first
occurrence. The cross-reference takes less space than the original data.
 
For example, the following phrase includes the repeated data "at ":
 
    The fat cat sat up.
 
DoubleSpace compresses this sentence by replacing the repeated "at "
characters (including the space) with a cross-reference to the first "at ".
In this example, cross- references are represented by the # character:
 
    The fat c#s#up.
 
Why does DoubleSpace compress some files more than others?
 
Some files contain more repeated data than others. For example, program
files are usually compiled so that they are stored as efficiently as
possible; program files are typically not as compressible as some other
types of files. Bitmap files and text files typically compress well, since
most such files contain a lot of repeated data. Files that were compressed
by using a standalone compression program such as PKZIP usually do not
compress any further; although you can store such files on a compressed
drive, there is little advantage to doing so.
 
Will DoubleSpace slow down my system?
 
If you have a computer with a fast CPU and a fast hard disk, you probably
won't notice much difference in system speed after installing DoubleSpace.
If you have a fast CPU and a slow hard disk, DoubleSpace might actually
improve your system's speed. If your computer has a slow CPU, you may notice
a reduction in speed after compressing your drive.
 
What happens during DoubleSpace Setup?
 
DoubleSpace Setup configures your computer to run DoubleSpace and compresses
the drive of your choice. DoubleSpace Setup first runs ScanDisk to check
your hard disk for logical and physical errors. If necessary, it runs the
Microsoft Defragmenter to defragment the files on your disk. Finally, it
compresses the files on your drive. For more information about running
DoubleSpace Setup, see the "Freeing Disk Space" chapter of the MS-DOS 6
User's Guide.
 
Now that I've installed DoubleSpace, why do I have an additional drive?
 
When DoubleSpace Setup is complete, you will have an additional drive.
 
If you chose to create a new compressed drive, the additional drive is the
compressed drive you just created.
 
If you compressed an existing drive (for example, drive C) the additional
drive is an uncompressed drive. It is used to store files that must remain
uncompressed (such as the Windows swap file). The additional drive also
contains important system files such as IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, DBLSPACE.BIN,
DBLSPACE.INI and DBLSPACE.000.
 
CAUTION:  Do not delete or otherwise tamper with the hidden files on the new
          drive. If you do, you might lose your compressed drive and all the
          files it contains.
 
For more information about DoubleSpace Setup, see "Understanding Disk
Compression" in the "Freeing Disk Space" chapter of the MS-DOS 6 User's
Guide.
 
Can I copy a file from a compressed drive to an uncompressed drive (such as
a floppy disk or a network drive)?
 
Yes. You can copy files between compressed drives and uncompressed drives
just as you would between two uncompressed drives. A file is actually
compressed only when it is stored on a compressed drive. When you copy a
file from your compressed drive, DoubleSpace reads the file into memory and
uncompresses it. The file is then copied to the uncompressed drive in its
uncompressed state.
 
If I compress a drive and then add more files to it, do I need to recompress
the drive?
 
No. Whenever you copy a file to a DoubleSpace drive, DoubleSpace saves the
file in compressed form. It doesn't matter whether the file was on the drive
when you compressed the drive.
 
If I'm using DoubleSpace, what should I do to maintain my system?
 
In general, maintaining a computer that's running DoubleSpace is just like
maintaining an uncompressed system. To ensure the safety of your data and
the stability of your system, do the following frequently (for example, once
a week):
 
  Back up your data files regularly. You can back up your files by using
   either Backup for MS-DOS or Backup for Windows. For more information, see
   the following section. Also, see the chapter "Managing Your System" in
   the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
  Check your hard disk regularly for logical and physical errors. To check
   and repair a drive, use the ScanDisk program. For more information, see
   <SCANDISK>.
 
  Check your computer's memory and hard disk for viruses. Viruses can
   damage data, and can even prevent your computer from starting or running
   properly. To check for viruses, use Anti-Virus. Be sure to check all your
   drives ฤฤ compressed and uncompressed drives. For more information, see
   the chapter "Managing Your System" in the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
  Defragment your hard disk drive periodically. (Since defragmentation can
   take a long time, you might want to do it at the end of the day.) For
   more information, see the chapter "Managing Your System" in the MS-DOS 6
   User's Guide.
 
  Set up Undelete so that you can restore any files that you accidentally
   delete. For information about setting up Undelete, see the chapter
   "Managing Your System" in the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.
 
How should I back up my files if I'm using DoubleSpace?
 
You should back up and restore the files on a compressed drive just as you
would the files on an uncompressed drive. (For information about using
Microsoft Backup, see the chapter "Managing Your System" in the MS-DOS 6
User's Guide.)
 
When backing up the files on the host drive (the uncompressed drive that
contains the compressed volume file (CVF) for your compressed drive), you
typically do not need to back up any files that have names in the form
DBLSPACE.nnn (for example, DBLSPACE.000). The DBLSPACE.nnn file essentially
contains your compressed drive. Although it is possible to back up the
DBLSPACE.nnn file, doing so is redundant if you have also backed up the
files on that compressed drive. In general, it's best to back up the files
on your compressed drive directly, rather than by backing up the associated
CVF (the DBLSPACE.nnn file). This is because backing up only the CVF does
not allow you to restore individual files or directories later. When you
restore the backup copy of a DBLSPACE.nnn file, it replaces the entire
compressed drive with the backup copy. This means that you will lose all
changes to all files on that drive that were made since the backup copy was
created.
 
I installed DoubleSpace and now I'm running out of memory. What can I do?
 
If you have an 80386 or higher computer, run <MemMaker> after installing
DoubleSpace. MemMaker can move portions of DoubleSpace out of conventional
memory, which makes more memory available for running programs. Also, make
sure the BUFFERS command in your CONFIG.SYS file is set to no more than 10
buffers. For more information about BUFFERS and DoubleSpace, see <BUFFERS>.
 
If you have an 80286 computer with at least 1 MB of memory, make sure your
CONFIG.SYS file contains a DOS=HIGH command and a DEVICE command for
HIMEM.SYS. (MS-DOS Setup normally adds these commands to your CONFIG.SYS
file.) With these commands, MS-DOS, and parts of DoubleSpace, can load into
the high memory area.
 
Is it all right to run SMARTDrive if I'm using DoubleSpace?
 
SMARTDrive and DoubleSpace are designed to work together. If Setup
determines that your computer has enough memory to run SMARTDrive, it
automatically installs SMARTDrive by adding a SMARTDRV command to your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. In particular, you should run SMARTDrive if you are
running DoubleSpace and you use Windows; in that case, using SMARTDrive can
significantly speed up your computer.
 
SMARTDrive is designed to speed up your system and safeguard your data. By
default, Setup configures SMARTDrive so that write-caching is disabled. (If
SMARTDrive was originally configured to allow write-caching, Setup will not
change your configuration.) Write-caching provides much faster performance
than read-only caching, but is not as conservative. For more information
about SMARTDrive, see <SMARTDRV>.
