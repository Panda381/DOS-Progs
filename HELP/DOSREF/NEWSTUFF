 This version of DOSREF is a bit different from the older shareware
versions.  As you may have noticed, I'm now promoting it as a "demo"
of the real thing.  You're welcome to use this copy of DOSREF with
my compliments - no need to feel guilty.  Hey, I'm a nice guy.  <grin>

 This "demo" version has quite a bit more detail than the previous
2.3c version.  You get nine chapters.  In these chapters, you now get
95% of the stuff in the full super-whoopie paid-for version's equivalent
chapters.  I left out some of the really esoteric or bulky stuff to keep
the file size down, but you have a majority of what you need to program
with, plus a ton of wierdo little facts that ought to keep you amused for
hours on end.

 Now, the object of this is to get you to buy the "real" DOSREF, of course.
If you look in the CONTENTS file, you'll see there's all sorts of other
stuff in the full version, as minutely detailed as what you just got.

 You get even more of the type of stuff you have in this archive, plus
over two megabytes of MORE stuff - XMS, EMS, VCPI, sound cards, APIs for
386 Multiware, Alloy NTNX, VMiX/386, Concurrent DOS/386 (most of which
applies to DR-Multiuser-DOS), Multi-DOS PLUS, NDIS networking, a complete
functioning TSR disk formatter with source to use as an example for writing
TSRs, or just yank for formatter code for your own programs.  You get dozens
of appendices covering everything from sound board file formats to address
lists.  Plus anything else I've added since this archive went out.

You can compare DOSREF against the stuff on the shelves at B.Dalton or
Waldenbooks, then look at what those Johnny-come-lately references COST.
Now, for only $25 you could get the full DOSREF and have as much info as
you could get from a whole shelf-full of books.  How can you beat a deal
like that?  


 Either way, please use and enjoy this demo copy of DOSREF.
