 I get a lot of mail from people outside the US who would like to get a
copy of DOSREF but aren't sure how to arrange payment.

Payment can be made via the following:

1)   Personal check, bank check, or money order in US dollars on a US bank.
     UK check in UK pounds, on a UK bank.
     Canadian check in Canadian dollars, on a Canadian bank.
        Please do not send Canadian checks in US dollars!  Use Canadian
        dollars.

2)   Canadian postal money orders payable in US dollars.

3)   International postal money order.
        Your local PTT may be able to issue United States Postal Money
        Orders.  I've gotten them from France and Japan, and they may be
        available elsewhere.  Note: while reliable, this tends to be slow.
        It seems to take about four weeks for them to get from Paris to
        St. Louis (the US Postal Service main offices) to me.

4)   US dollars, Canadian dollars, UK pounds - cash
        You can sometimes buy foreign currency at a bank or airport at the
        current exchange rate.  Fold the notes over with cardboard or
        heavy paper.  You might wish to consider registered, certified,
        or insured mail.  Tape the envelope shut.

5)   Traveler's checks payable in US dollars.

6)   EuroCheques payable in UK pounds.  Please do not get Eurocheques in
        US dollars or Canadian dollars - my banks cannot cash them!

7)   US stamps.
        I will accept unused US stamps at face value.

8)   Spearwood Shareware Services.
        Spearwood is a disk vendor in Australia.  They are authorized to
        accept orders for DOSREF.  Australian registrants may consider them,
        as they can take Australian checks, Mastercard, and VISA.

9)   VISA/Mastercard.
        If you decide to pay by credit card, I will need the following
        information:
                your name as it is on the card
                the billing address for the card
                the date the card expires
                type of card (VISA, etc)
                your legal signature
                your account number
                the name of the bank which issued the card
        I have to process these through a third-party service, and it can
        take up to three weeks for it to clear.

10)  DP Tool Club.
        Nicolas Kelemen's shareware service will arrange payment to me if
        you send him French francs, credit cards, or some European currencies.
        Nicolas will forward your order to me via E-mail so you get it as
        quickly as possible.  You can contact him at:
                DP Tool Club
                B.P. 745
                59657 Villeneuve d'Ascq
                FRANCE
                FAX:   +33- 2056 5525
                Phone: +33- 2056 5533
                CIS:   100012,1410
        There is no charge for this service.


 I have bank accounts in the USA, Canada, and England. If you can make payment
in any of those currencies, everything's OK.

 If nothing above looks helpful, check with your local airport, US consulate,
or a travel agency.  Someone there might be able to help you.

 In INVOICE.TRF there are prices for US, Canadian, and Australian dollars,
and in UK pounds.  I called my local bank, found out the exchange rates, and
wrote down the prices.  As relative currency prices move around, you might
get a really good deal or a bad deal.  If the exchange rate slides too much,
just find the current rate for that many US dollars and send that.


I can not accept:

1)   Checks in US dollars, drawn on a non-US bank.
        note:   US banks are all tied together on a big network. If you look
                at the bottom of a US check, you'll see a long row of numbers.
                This is a routing code, identifying the bank and the particular
                account.  The network does not recognize non-US banks, so
                although your non-US check is perfectly good, it cannot be
                cashed without going into "special services", which usually
                cost more than the face value of the check.



Addressing:
        Please list your first name, last name, and COMPLETE mailing address.
        Though your local postal service may accept packages with something
        like "P. Hunter, Plymouth, England" and deliver them, sometimes Customs
        will send improperly addressed packages back to me.

        If your country does not use Roman letters you may wish to enclose
        return address labels in your language AND English - the US Postal
        Service will not accept packages if they can't read the label.

        If you provide an addressed mailing label with your order it will
        help.  Sometimes it's hard to read some people's writing, and you'd
        hate for your package to get delivered to the wrong place or returned
        to me, right?


Customs:
        All DOSREF packages shipped outside the USA have the international
        "CUSTOMS-DOUANE C 1" green sticker, with a declared value of one US
        dollar and contents listed as "floppy disks".  Most customs inspectors
        figure any floppy disk is worth a dollar, and the data is appraised
        separately.  If you want the sticker to say something else, send a
        note or filled-out sticker with your order.

Postage:
        All international orders go by standard US International Air Mail.
        The US Postal Service is generally quite efficient, as are the
        Canadian and UK PTTs, but the interface between them is run by
        chimpanzees.  Maybe the mail sits around for the Customs people to
        sift through; I don't know.  Some packages to Israel evidently
        went to the Bermuda Triangle.  If you don't receive your order in
        a reasonable time, send me a postcard or leave a message on the
        support BBS, (501) 985-0059.

Support:
        30% of my registered users are from outside the US.  They get the
        same support (BBS or mail) and upgrade notices as US users.


     ******************************** PLEASE ****************************

 I offer several shareware programs.  Please print out the order form for
this one, or write the name of the program you want on your check or on a
piece of paper.  If I don't know what you're ordering, I'll have to return
your payment.

                                                                Thank you.
