  The information presented here was gathered from megabytes of files 
found on BBS systems, conversations on a dozen different BBS systems, 
correspondence, and every reference book I could get my hands on.  On 
occasion, a number of prestigious references didn't agree with each 
other.  Where this has happened, I have used the latest references.  
There is too much information here for me to verify every fact 
personally.  I have used my own judgement as to the reliability of the 
sources. 

  I've been selling copies of the Reference since October 1987.  The 
original basis for the Reference came from Peter Norton's 
"Programmer's Guide to the IBM PC" and the original Janet Jack 
interrupt list circa sometime 1986, as updated by Ross Greenberg, plus 
a copy of the IBM DOS 3.1 Technical Reference.  It's grown a bit, eh?  
Anyway, I've prepared a list of the sources I've used for the 
Reference to clear up any curiosity as to where the material came 
from. 



Tools used in preparing this book:


Microsoft SymDeb, the final gasp of venerable DEBUG.COM and a fine 
program. 

Microsoft CodeView, huge and awkward though it may be.

V Communications Sourcer, the only effective disassembler I've found.

        comment: This manual does not cover the extended disk partition
                 access, file password protection, or any of the other
                 goodies provided in DR-DOS.  In fact, it not only
                 doesn't cover the extended features, it doesn't
                 completely cover DOS calls documented by IBM.  It does
                 have an extensive section on customizing DR-DOS for
                 use from ROM.

  Western Digital, Rodime, Miniscribe, Microscience, Adaptec, Storage

hard drive information in Appendix 6. 

***************************

  A large amount of miscellaneous information came from various 
computer magazines.  Documenting what came from where would be an 
experience all its own.  A great deal of information came from 
articles by Michael Mefford, Jim Prosise, and Charles Petzold of PC 
Magazine, and Neil Rubenking, Jeff Duntemann, and Ray Duncan, who get 
around a lot. 

   Byte
        ( Byte's kinda weird. They have some really neat, well-
          researched stuff interspersed with mindless drivel.  Still,
          they print some stuff you absolutely, positively won't find
          anywhere else. )

   C Users Journal
        ( Despite the name, it's mainly about programming DOS machines)

   C'T (Computer Technik)
        ( If you read German, this one is sorta like PC Magazine was
          in its heyday. )

   Computer Language
        ( I never decided if I liked CL or not.  Maybe I'm not the 
          sort of programmer they're writing for... ) (04/93 - just
          got word CL is dead.  Maybe nobody else knew who they were
          writing for either)

   Computer Shopper
        ( Though primarily advertising, some information sneaks in
          from time to time. )

   Dr. Dobb's Journal
        ( I always thought the old title, "Doctor Dobbs' Journal of
          Computer Calisthenics and Orthodontia - Running Light
          Without Overbyte" was a killer name, but nobody asked me. )

   InfoWorld
        ( I never really figured out how a weekly magazine could so
          often be both late *and* wrong with their stories, but IW
          tries hard.  Still, you often hear about rumblings you'd
          never find out about in the slicks.  The National Enquirer
          of the computer world? )

   Micro Cornucopia
        ( R.I.P - it was great while it lasted. )

   Microsoft Systems Journal
        ( Hideously expensive and mostly oriented to Windows, the
          early issues had some really good stuff )

   Midnight Engineering
        ( This one's hard to classify.  It's hardcore computer with a
          dash of entrepreneurship, bizarre as the combination may
          sound.  I like it when I can find it. )

   PC Magazine
        ( Despite their new "management format" in mid '89, PC Mag
          still has some good techie stuff from time to time.  I guess
          the bean counters thought managers were more important than
          programmers. )

   PC Resource
        ( There was rarely anything of interest in PC Resource, but
          every now and then I found something.  Now defunct. )

   PC Tech Journal
        ( "Tell 'em what you're going to say, tell 'em what you're
          saying, tell 'em what you just said." - and don't send us
          no steenking submissions unless they're in WordPerfect
          format!  Despite their fascist policies, every now and then
          they printed something useful.  The Little Rock Wild Bunch
          referred to it as "PC Tech Urinal," an apt monicker.  Now
          defunct. )

   PC Techniques
        ( This is the magazine PC Tech Journal tried to advertise
          itself as.  Pure programming, written by programmers for
          programmers, without too many "journalists" pissing in the
          text.  Try it! )

   PC Week
        ( This one used to be a clone of InfoWorld, but since their
          takeover by PC Magazine they've become a sort of mutant
          cross between IW and PCMag. )

   Programmer's Journal
        ( This is a nice magazine, though expensive. - now defunct )

   Tech Specialist (now Windows/DOS Developer's Journal)
        ( One of the few really good magazines for bit-twiddlers.
          Haven't seen a GUI phone-dialer shootout yet! )

   Windows Tech Journal
        ( This one is sort of neat even if you don't like Windows.  It's
          another "by programmers, for programmers" rag, lots of code
          with a dash of humor.)

  DOSREF isn't a tutorial, and sometimes you need a tutorial.  
Microsoft has finally written a half-decent one - The MS-DOS 
Programmer's Reference, Microsoft Press, 1991, ISBN 1-55615-329-5.  
This is the DOS 5.0 Tech Ref. It covers data structures and DOS 
programming concepts clearly.  However, it has no information on other 
DOS versions, nor does it (of course) cover undocumented calls. 

                     ------------------------------------

  Nothing gets written in a vacuum, and I'd like to express my thanks 
to all the people who have been good enough to furnish information and 
support: 
   (in alphabetical order)

Tommy Apple, Mike Crawford, Herman Diagostino, Joe Felix, Ron Melson, 
Denis Murphy, & Ben Sansing, 
        who all loaned me documentation and reference material for
        so long that some of them have forgotten to ask for their
        stuff back


 And those people who were kind enough to help out:

Mike Blaszczak, MA:
BIX: blaszczak
        who went rampaging through work and client's sites to find and 
        document various model ID bytes, plus plenty of information on 
        MS OBJ file formats 

Carl Bretteville, Drammen Norway:
        who sent me a complete Concurrent DOS Programmer's Reference, 
        considerably enriching the Norwegian postal service thereby 

William Cravener 
CIS: 72230,1306
         who allowed me to include his PORT-IN.OUT file 

John Dallman 
jgd@cix.clink.co.uk
        more information on eDOS 4.0 

Herman Diagostino, Manassas VA: who worked up the TECHMENU menu file 
        and provided a copy of the rare IBM DOS 4.0 Technical 
        Reference and a copy of the original MSDOS Encyclopedia from
