here's what users are saying about DOSREF:

"If it weren't for DOSREF, ladies in white coats and caps would probably be
spoon feeding me oatmeal while I laid around in Smurf underwear watching
Gilligan's Island reruns."    - D.S., Willits CA, 1991

"I thank you for making available an awesome compilation of information for a 
modest price."  - M.C., Staten Island NY 1991

"Let me add my voice to those who praise your industry and results!!  You
have created a fine and very useful document.  Well DONE!!"  - R.C.,
Mississauga, ON., 1991

"Your description of entry and return values for the various interrupts is
much more detailed than several books I have bought which contain similar
information."  - J.E., Bethesda MD, 1991

"I must admit, when I first retrieved your reference text from the Internet,
I had no idea what I was getting.  When it took me 20 minutes to download the
thing from the computers at work (AMD) at 2400 baud, I began to think
something must be wrong.  Now that I've printed the thing out, I must say,
"I'm impressed."  That's a hell of a lot of information."  - S.T., Austin

"Your manual is excellent and well worth your reasonable support fee"

TITLE: Programmer's Technical Reference
I have just received a copy of dave2's labor of love.  This thing
is unbelievable.  It has *everything*.  In the past I've relied
on a combination of Ray Duncan's book, the ibm.dos/secrets.*
conferences, and Ralf Brown's INTER190.EXE.  This thing has it
all, all in one place.

Thanks, Dave, for a job well done.

Will do, Dave.  Thank you.  I must say, your book has been invaluable to
me.  You mentioned in one of the sections that you were surprised how many
blind programmers benefited from this work.  Well, I'm another one to add
to the list.  Thanks again, it is great.
