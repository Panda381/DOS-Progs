 This archive contains a demo version of DOSREF.  It contains 95% of the
basic information you actually need to program a PC under DOS.  You're
welcome to use this demo without obligation or payment, with my compliments.

 However, if you want MORE STUFF, you might want to register your copy of
DOSREF.

   Why register DOSREF instead of relying on one of those public domain
 "interrupt lists"?  Sheer size, for one.  Even in LHarc format DOSREF
 bulks out to over two megabytes.  Registered users also get support via:

        The Courts of Chaos BBS (DOSREF support board)
        internet
        CompuServe
        airmail

  You get the very latest edition of this manual on disk, with no worries
 about corrupted or tampered text.  DOSREF is a quality product, in use
 by the US Navy, CalTech, Borland, NEC, Wang, General Motors, Citicorp,
 Rockwell, Honeywell, Digital Research, Central Point Software, 20th Century
 Fox, Associated Press, hospitals, universities, and government agencies
 around the world.

  The Registered User reference consists of over two megabytes of compressed
 technical reference, appendices, and sample source code. That's about four
 megabytes of raw data when uncompressed, or several times larger than the
 shareware version.

  The Registered User version contains information on device drivers, mouse
 programming, Virtual Control Program Interface, hard drives, hardware
 information, virus and Trojan programs, EMS 3.2, LIM 4.0, EEMS 3.2, CD-ROM,
 network programming, DOS 5.0, various multitasking and network APIs, and
 more.

  Registered users will be advised by mail of updates.

  Several people who have downloaded copies many years old have written
 to see if I was still supporting the Reference.  The answer is yes.  Not only
 that, but my book contract calls for keeping the information current.  If
 you're concerned, just drop a postcard.

 Foreign langauge versions are available!

  Klaus Overhage of Stuttgart, West Germany has licensed DOSref for
 redistribution and is now able to provide versions in German.  Klaus' version
 is a separate product from this one and must be purchased separately. Klaus
 is providing full support for German users.  If you'd like a copy in German,
 please contact:

                             Klaus Overhage

                             Germany

  I hope to have other languages available soon.  If you are interested in
purchase or translation, please contact me for details.

  Do you live outside the US?  If so, you're probably familiar with the
 hassles of keeping up with the latest information - the three to five month
 lead time for US publication, plus time for local book dealers to catalog
 new releases, plus problems in trying to order... plus the delays while your
 book comes in on special order, goes through Customs, the inevitable price
 hikes through all the middlemen, taxes...  not only is DOSREF priced
 well below the price of good printed computer books in the US, it's probably
 far cheaper than you could expect to pay for US books locally.  Plus your
 order will show up in your very own mailbox by air mail.
