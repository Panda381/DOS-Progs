          Introduction to Image Alchemy
          -----------------------------------------------------------------          -----------------------------------------------------------------


          What is Image    Image Alchemy is a software utility that
          Alchemy?         manipulates computer image files.

                           The main thing that Image Alchemy does is to
                           convert between various graphics file formats.
                           Image Alchemy can translate between a large
                           variety of file formats including industry
                           standards such as GIF and TIFF and vendor
                           specific file formats such as Sun Raster and
                           Scodl.  Currently Alchemy supports over 30
                           different formats, and new formats are always
                           being added; in fact, our goal is to have Image
                           Alchemy be able to read and write every graphic
                           file in the world.

                           Image Alchemy can also make changes in an image.
                           For example, Image Alchemy can re-size an image,
                           change the number of colours in an image, change
                           an image from colour to black and white, and
                           change the colour space an image uses.

                           Finally, Image Alchemy performs JPEG
                           compression.  This is a new standard for image
                           compression that can achieve much higher
                           compression ratios than conventional compression
                           techniques.  It achieves this high compression
                           ratio by not entirely preserving the original
                           image (this is referred to as "lossy"
                           compression).  For further information see
                           Appendix C, What is JPEG Compression.

          Pathnames        Because the MS-DOS and UNIX operating systems
                           use different conventions for path names users
                           of UNIX will have to substitute forward slashes,
                           "/", for the back slashes, "\", found in the
                           examples in this manual.



          Unintentional    UNIX users should also be aware that the UNIX
          wildcard         shell they are using may be performing wildcard
          expansion        expansion on certain characters (generally "*"
                           and "?").  Since these are options which Alchemy
                           uses they need to be escaped to prevent the
                           wildcard substitution.  This is done by using a
                           back slash, "\", before the character (so -?
                           becomes -\?).

          Installing Image Alchemy
          -----------------------------------------------------------------          -----------------------------------------------------------------


          Overview         Installation of Image Alchemy is simple; it
                           involves copying the Alchemy program off of the
                           floppy disk or tape onto your hard drive or
                           network.

                           You need to be familiar with the copy command if
                           doing a DOS installation and the tar command if
                           doing a UNIX installation.  If you are not
                           familiar with these commands you may wish to
                           read the manuals which came with your computer
                           or ask someone to assist you.

                           The installation instructions are divided into
                           different sections for IBM PC, Sun-4 (Sparc),
                           and Sun-3.  Please refer to the section which
                           corresponds to your hardware.

          Required         At a minimum you must have the following
          equipment        hardware and software to run Image Alchemy.



                 Computer  An MS-DOS computer equipped with an 80286,
                           80386, or 80486.

                           Many of the conversions that Alchemy does are
                           cpu intensive, so a faster computer is
                           definitely an advantage.



                   Memory  At least 380k of free memory.

                           Image Alchemy will run much faster if you have
                           more than 420k of memory available.  Some
                           conversions and some images require even more
                           memory (Alchemy will attempt to use all
                           available system memory, so if you get out of
                           memory errors or warnings try removing as many
                           resident programs as you can (also, installing
                           MS-DOS 5.0 will free up more memory)).

                           Alchemy does not currently make use of expanded
                           or extended memory.



               Hard drive  A hard drive with at least as much free space as
                           four times the size of the image being converted
                           (i.e. a 640x480 image will require approximately
                           1.2 megabytes of free space).



                  Display  A supported SVGA or 8514/A board, if you wish to
                           view images.

                           Supported SVGA boards include those with the
                           Paradise, Everex, Trident, Video 7, and the
                           Tseng Labs chipsets.  Supported 8514/A boards
                           include IBM and those with the Western Digital
                           chipset.

                Operating  MS-DOS or PC-DOS 3.x or greater (because of the
                   system  additional free memory available use of MS-DOS
                           5.0 is highly recommended).



          Optional         The following hardware and software is optional
          equipment        to run Image Alchemy.



           VESA VGA board  To get full use out of viewing images on a SVGA
                           board a VESA driver is needed.  Without a VESA
                           driver Alchemy is limited to displaying images
                           in 320x200x256, 360x480x256, and 640x400x256
                           mode;  with a VESA driver the resolution is
                           limited only by your SVGA board and monitor.
                           Resolutions up to 1280x1024x256 are possible.

                           The VESA driver is supplied by the manufacturer
                           of your SVGA board.  It may already be included
                           in the BIOS on your SVGA board, or it may have

               Disk cache  You can greatly increase the speed of many of
                           Image Alchemy's conversions by installing a disk
                           cache that postpones writes.  This is because
                           Alchemy uses the hard drive to temporarily store
                           data during many conversions.  A write
                           postponing cache will use extended and/or
                           expanded memory to make this more efficient.

                           An example of a write postponing cache, and the
                           one we use at Handmade Software, is the Norton
                           Utilities 6.01 supplied ncache.exe (the cache
                           supplied with MS-DOS 5.0, smartdrv.sys, is NOT a
                           write postponing cache, and while it will help
                           somewhat, it is not nearly as effective).

                           Refer to the documentation that came with your
                           cache on how to install it.



                     Math  A math coprocessor will not affect the speed of
              coprocessor  most operations; the only operations that use
                           much floating point math are scaling types c and

          Installation     Using the MS-DOS copy command copy the program
          instructions     ALCHEMY.EXE to a directory in your path.  There
                           are no support or configuration files which need
                           to be copied.  (For more information on the copy
                           command or the path command see the DOS user's
                           manual which came with MS-DOS).

          Note to advanced Alchemy uses the environment variable TMP to
          users            determine where to open its temporary files.  If
                           you have a big enough ram drive you will want to
                           specify it using the TMP variable.  Be aware
                           that Alchemy needs up to 4 times as much space
                           on that drive as the size of the image (a 640 by
                           480 image requires up to 1.2 Megabytes).  An
                           example of setting the TMP variable to drive e:
                           would be "set TMP=e:".

          Note to advanced Alchemy uses the environment variable TMPDIR to
          users            determine where to put its temporary files.
                           This is usually set to /usr/tmp or /tmp, but if
                           you are converting very large images there may
                           not be enough space available in the partition
                           those directories are on.  In that case you may
                           want to set the environment variable TMPDIR to a
                           different partition.  For example, to set the
                           temporary file directory to the directory

          Introduction
          -----------------------------------------------------------------          -----------------------------------------------------------------


          Basic            Image Alchemy is a command line driven program.
          instructions     This is different from a menu driven or mouse
                           driven program in that you instruct Alchemy what
                           to do only when you execute it from the command
                           line.  Once the program is running there are no
                           further choices or user interaction.

                           The basic Image Alchemy usage instructions are:

                           alchemy -option [-option ...] inputFileName
                           [outputFileName] [outputPathName]

                           This simply means that you type the name of the
                           program, Alchemy, followed by at least one
                           option, followed by the input file name.  You
                           may optionally specify an output file name or an
                           output path name.

                  Options  Options are the commands that you give Alchemy
                           so that it knows what you want it to do.  So
                           that Alchemy can distinguish between options and
                           file names, options are preceded by a dash ("-
                           ").

                           The only option that is required is the output
                           file format (or the viewing option, for MS-DOS
                           users).  Image Alchemy will make reasonable
                           decisions for all of the other options.

                           Some options take parameters.  The parameters
                           may immediately follow the option or be
                           separated by a space.  For example, either -c128
                           or -c 128 is acceptable.

                           The options are documented in Chapters 3 through
                           7.

                           Note that options can appear anywhere in the
                           command line and generally they can be in any
                           order (certain options take parameters; in those
                           cases the parameters must follow the option).
                           The case of the options is significant.

            InputFileName  The inputFileName is any valid file name.  This
                           is the name of an existing image file that you
                           are converting from or viewing.  The
                           inputFileName is required.  It may include an
                           optional drive and/or path.

           OutputFileName  The outputFileName is the name of the file you
                           are converting the image to.  The outputFileName
                           is optional;  if it is not specified Image
                           Alchemy generates one by substituting an
                           appropriate extension to the input file name.
                           If you specify an outputFileName and it does not
                           include an extension one will be added.  The
                           outputFileName may include an optional drive
                           and/or path.  If you do not supply a path the
                           current directory will be used as the
                           destination directory.

           OutputPathName  The outputPathName is the location where you
                           want to put the output that Alchemy will create.
                           The outputPathName is optional;  if it is not
                           specified Alchemy places the output in the
                           current directory or in the directory specified
                           as part of the outputFileName.



          Limitations on   Since Alchemy lets you optionally enter a space
          filenames        between an option and its parameter it is
                           possible to confuse Alchemy if one of the
                           filenames starts with a number.  In particular,
                           if you use an option which has an optional
                           parameter, you do not use a parameter, and you
                           follow that option immediately with a filename
                           which starts with a number, Alchemy doesn't
                           realize that the filename is not the parameter.
                           While it sounds unlikely that this would ever be
                           a problem it actually happens quite often.

                           For example, if you wanted to convert the file
                           12.gif to a Targa file with the name output.tga
                           you would have to be careful of the order you
                           specified things.

                           If you say

                                alchemy -a 12.gif output.tga

                           Alchemy would misinterpret that as

                                alchemy -a12 .gif output.tga



     Image Alchemy v1.5  Copyright (c) 1990-91 Handmade Software Inc.     2-2



                           and would generate an error.

                           The easiest way around this problem is to always
                           put the filenames first

                                alchemy 12.gif output.tga -a

                           or don't use filenames which begin with a
                           number.

          Output path      The output path name is the location where
                           Alchemy will place its output.

                           The outputPathName can be specified as part of
                           the outputFileName if you are specifying an
                           outputFileName.

                           For example

                                alchemy sample.jpg -g test.gif \images

                           is the same as

                                alchemy sample.jpg -g \images\test.gif

                           However,

                                alchemy sample.jpg -g

                           is not the same as

                                alchemy sample.jpg -g \images

                           When using the wildcard option, Alchemy allows
                           wildcards and multiple file names.  In this case
                           the use of an outputFileName is not allowed, but
                           the use of the outputPathName is.  See the
                           wildcard option below for more information.

          Using multiple   Sometimes you may know what you want to
          runs of Alchemy  accomplish but not how to specify the correct
                           combination of options.  For example, you may
                           wish to re-size a true colour Targa file that
                           you have scanned and convert it to a 16 colour
                           GIF file.  Let's say that the input file name is
                           file.tga and you want to generate a file with
                           the name file.gif. In this case you could type:

                                alchemy file.tga -Xb640 -Yb480 -c16 -g

                           However, there would be no penalty in quality
                           (and little in speed) if you did things in two
                           steps:

                                alchemy file.tga -Xb640 -Yb480 -r temp.raw

                                alchemy temp.raw -c16 -g file.gif

                           In this case you are telling Alchemy to use a
                           temporary raw file called temp.raw.  It turns
                           out that Alchemy would have done that
                           automatically in the first case.  Of course you
                           will have to manually delete the file temp.raw
                           when the conversion is finished.

                           The order of steps is important in many cases.
                           For example, reversing the order of the two
                           operations in the previous example:

                                alchemy file.tga -c16 -g temp.raw

                                alchemy temp.raw -Xb640 -Yb480 -g file

                           would give different results.  This is because
                           the scaling operation has to temporarily convert
                           the image to true colour, but the GIF file you
                           are generating has to be paletted, so the second
                           operation would re-dither the image.

                           Sometimes you will have to perform operations
                           using multiple steps because there are some
                           combinations of options that Alchemy explicitly
                           does not allow.  These combinations of options
                           are not allowed because the results would not be
                           what you expect.

                           For example, using the spiff option, -S, in
                           combination with the false colour option, -F,
                           would spiff the image first and then false
                           colour it, which would give the same results as
                           just using the false colour option.  Since that
                           isn't something that you would ever want to do,
                           Alchemy will complain if you specify both of
                           those options at the same time.

                           In this case you could false colour the image
                           first, generating a temporary image, and then
                           spiff that image.

          Output Options
          -----------------------------------------------------------------          -----------------------------------------------------------------


          Introduction     The one option which is always required when
                           running Image Alchemy is the output image file
                           type.  Even if you are just re-sizing an image,
                           or changing the number of colours in an image,
                           Alchemy needs to know what type of image you are
                           creating.

                           The file types that Image Alchemy supports are
                           listed below.  In addition to the syntax
                           required to generate the file, any known
                           restrictions or limitations are listed.  If you
                           have trouble reading an image in one of the file
                           formats we claim to support please contact us
                           (see Appendix D, Customer Support).

                           The common output options consist of a single
                           letter.  The option, like all Alchemy options,
                           is preceded by a dash, "-".  The less common
                           output options consist of a letter preceded by
                           two dashes, "--".

               Variations  Some of the output formats have several
                           variations; in those cases you specify which
                           variation you want with an optional letter
                           and/or number after the output option.

                  Example  The option to generate a Windows Bitmap file is
                           -w.  There are two types of Bitmap files:
                           uncompressed and Run-Length-Encoded (RLE).  To
                           write out an uncompressed Bitmap file use -w0;
                           to write out a RLE Bitmap file use -w1 (the
                           default Bitmap file is uncompressed, so a -w
                           without any parameter following it would also
                           generate an uncompressed Bitmap file).  Note
                           that Alchemy allows spaces between the option
                           and parameter, so typing -w 1 would be the same
                           as -w1.

               Variations  Be aware that the other options specified on the
                           command line also affect the type of file that
                           is generated.

                  Example  Within the Windows Bitmap file type there are 1
                           bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit files.

                           Alchemy always generates a file using the best
                           match of the file type and the output image.
                           So, in the case of Windows Bitmap files, if the
                           output image is black and white a 1 bit file is
                           generated.  If the output image is paletted with
                           16 colours or less a 4 bit file is generated.
                           If the output image is paletted with more than
                           16 colours an 8 bit file is generated.  And if
                           the output image is true colour a 24 bit file is
                           generated.

                           You can explicitly force any of these file types
                           by using other Alchemy options.  For example, if
                           you wanted a 1 bit Windows Bitmap file you would
                           specify -c2 -b -w.  To force a 4 bit file use
                           -c16 -w.  To force an 8 bit file use -c256 -w.
                           And to force a true colour file use -24 -w.


          Identifying      Image Alchemy identifies the type of file being
          image files      read by checking various magic numbers and other
                           information that varies from format to format.
                           Unfortunately some formats do not have a magic
                           number; in those cases Alchemy guesses as to the
                           image type.  It is possible for Image Alchemy to
                           incorrectly identify an image; if this happens
                           please contact us.

          MacBinary        When reading images Alchemy automatically
                           recognizes and reads MacBinary files (MacBinary
                           files are generated when you accidently leave
                           MacBinary mode on when transferring a file from
                           a Macintosh).

          Other            Alchemy will preserve as much information in
          information      each file as is reasonable; this always includes
                           the height and width of the image and the number
                           of colours in the image.  Some file types
                           include other data, such as the name of the
                           image, the aspect ratio of the image, the date
                           the image was created, etc.  Since most of these
                           items are only supported by a few file formats,
                           Alchemy discards everything but the height,
                           width, number of colours, gamma, aspect ratio,
                           and resolution values.

          Binary Information Files (BIF)                                 -B


                           There are quite a few programs which produce
                           image files which contain just pixel data.
                           These image files do not have a header and hence
                           do not include enough information to allow
                           Alchemy to read them.

                           BIF files are a method which can be used to
                           allow Alchemy to read these images.  BIF files
                           can also be created to allow images to be read
                           by software which expects images to be just
                           pixels.  Since required information, such as the
                           height and width of the image, are not present
                           in these files you must supply it.

                           black and white.

          Limitations      Paletted files can not be read in (a work around
                           is to generate a .PAL file and then false colour
                           the gray-scale image using the -F option).

          Comments         BIF files are used to read and write files which
                           consist entirely of image data.  You have to
                           generate a text file which describes the format
                           of the data you are trying to read in.  This
                           file is called a BIF file.  The format of BIF
                           files is documented in Appendix E, Binary
                           Information Files.  You then instruct Alchemy to
                           read the image data by giving it the name of the
                           .BIF file.

                           is always required.

          Comments         Freedom of the Press images are actually two
                           files, a data file and an info file.  You
                           specify the name of the data file and Alchemy
                           automatically generates the name of the info
                           file.  The output file is normally output.001,
                           output.002, etc.  Alchemy will strip the first
                           part of the name and replace it with 'info', so
                           if you specified an output filename of
                           output.005 there will be another file created
                           called info.005.  If you don't specify an
                           extension, Alchemy will use .fop, so you'll get
                           two files named filename.fop and info.fop.
                           Alchemy will overwrite info files without
                           warning.

                           GIF files were originally developed by
                           CompuServe as a machine independent image file
                           format.  GIF files are clearly the most popular
                           way of storing 8 bit, scanned or digitized
                           images.  In addition the compression ratio
                           achieved by GIF files is usually better than any
                           other 8 bit format in common use.  GIF89A files
                           were introduced in 1990 as a method for
                           including text and simple animations.

                           Writes 1 through 8 bit GIF87A and GIF89A non-
                           interleaved files.

          Limitations      When reading GIF89A files only the first image
                           in the file is read.  Any text, overlays,
                           pauses, palette changes, etc. are ignored.

                           Because GIF files only store the size of the
                           palette to the nearest power of 2 the exact
                           palette size is lost when converting to and from
                           GIF files.  For example, if you convert a 240
                           colour Sun Raster file to a GIF file and back to
                           a Sun Raster file the resulting Sun Raster file
                           will have 256 colours.

          Comments         When writing a file you probably want to use the
                           GIF87A variation, since the GIF89A extensions
                           aren't necessary to store single images and a
                           lot of other software still can't read GIF89A
                           images.  The only advantage to GIF89A is that
                           the aspect ratio of the image is preserved
                           (GIF87A does not have a provision for storing
                           aspect ratio).

                           The GIF format includes a field for storing the
                           colour to be used for the background when
                           viewing files.  Alchemy does not make use of
                           this value.  Alchemy sets the background colour
                           to the darkest colour in the palette when
                           viewing files and organizes the palette such
                           that the first colour is the darkest colour when
                           writing GIF files, if the palette is created by
                           Alchemy (you can override this by using the -z
                           option).

                           compressed files.

          Limitations      In addition to raster images, PCL files can
                           include text and vector graphics information.
                           When reading Alchemy only pays attention to
                           raster images in the file and attempts to skip
                           everything else.  See Appendix A, Answers to
                           Frequently Asked Questions, for further
                           discussion of this.

                           The only resolutions allowed in PCL files are
                           75 DPI, 100 DPI, 150 DPI, and 300 DPI; the X and
                           Y resolution must be the same.  If you specify
                           any other resolution Alchemy automatically
                           alters the resolution to the next higher
                           resolution.  If no resolution is specified the
                           default is 300 DPI.

          Comments         Since PCL files are always 1 bit, black and
                           white files, Alchemy assumes the use of the -b,
                           -c2, and -8 options.

                           When converting colour or gray-scale images to
                           PCL you will probably want to scale the output
                           so the image will be larger than the input
                           image.  This will allow the dithering to
                           preserve more detail in the image.

                           PCL files can be used to generate output which
                           can be printed on HP LaserJet and compatible
                           printers.  The easiest method is to simply
                           generate a .PCL file and then copy it to the
                           printer by using the copy command (when using
                           the copy command from MS-DOS you will have to
                           use a /B to make sure the entire file is copied
                           to the printer; see the example below for more
                           information).

                           All HP laser printers can print uncompressed
                           files.  The newer models, including the HP
                           LaserJet III series, can print TIFF compressed
                           files.  TIFF compressed files are smaller, and
                           therefore are faster to transmit to the printer.

          Examples         Convert the image image.gif to a HP PCL file,
                           using no compression:

                           The output file is always colour, even if the
                           image is black & white.

          Comments         RTL files can be used to produce output which
                           can be printed on HP colour printers and raster
                           plotters.  The file can be printed by sending
                           the file to the plotter.  There is no additional
                           setup required for the PaintJet.  HP7600 series
                           plotters should be in HP-GL/2 mode; best results
                           will generally be achieved with compensation
                           off.  To get colour plots from the HP7600 series
                           the plotter must be in 4 or 5 pass mode.  The
                           file must be sent to the printer/plotter in
                           binary mode (for MS-DOS systems, use the /B
                           option with the copy command).

                           If the input is black and white, you probably
                           want to do the conversion without an undercolour
                           removal file and with dithering off.  See below
                           for an example.

                           If the input is gray-scale, you probably do want
                           to use an undercolour removal file to perform
                           density correction, but with 100% black removal
                           (the black removal tables should contain 0
                           through 255, increasing by one each line) so
                           that the output won't contain cyan, magenta, or
                           yellow.  The sample directory on the
                           distribution diskette has a UCR file called
                           gray.ucr which has 100% black removal.

                           images often have large areas where the image
                           consists of 1 or 2 colours; JPEG compression
                           does a poor job on these sections when compared
                           to LZW compression.  HSI JPEG files are a
                           combination of JPEG and LZW compression.

          Comments         If you're writing an ILBM file for use on an
                           Amiga, you probably want to write either a

          Used by          Lossy compression of photographic images.

          Variations       Gray-scale images are saved as single channel
                           JPEG files; colour images are saved as three

                           Huffman coded.

                           Alchemy can read files with any component sub-
                           sampling up to 4x4; it always writes 2h:1v 1h:1v
                           1h:1v.

                           Alchemy JPEG files comply with the industry
                           standard `JFIF' interchange format.

          Limitations      Can not read non-interleaved JPEG files.

                           JPEG files are always lossy, which means that
                           the compressed image is not identical to the
                           original image.  At high quality factors (32 and
                           above) this loss is generally so slight as to be
                           barely noticeable.  There is no quality factor
                           which is guaranteed to be lossless.

          Comments         By default, Image Alchemy uses a fixed set of
                           Huffman tables to compress an image.  If the -j
                           is immediately followed by an 'h', Alchemy will
                           generate a set of custom tables optimized for
                           the image and quality factor.  This usually
                           produces 5-20% better compression (depending on
                           the image content and quality factor) but
                           requires an additional pass over the image data,
                           so it takes a little longer to compress (there's
                           no effect on the decompression time).

                           Quality may vary between 1 and 100; the default
                           is 32.  The higher the number the higher the
                           quality of the image and the lower the
                           compression ratio.  Quality factors below 10
                           will produce images with significant loss of
                           quality.

                           JPEG files are based on the Joint Photographic
                           Experts Group (JPEG) CD 10918-1 draft standard.

                           Since JPEG compression was designed for use with
                           continuous tone images (such as those produced
                           by a scanner or digitizer), poor results can be
                           expected when compressing line drawings.

          Related options  -q   Apply Smoothing when decompressing a JPEG
                           image.

                           Because JPEG compression works on 8x8 pixel
                           blocks there may be discontinuities at the edges
                           of these blocks producing block artifacts.
                           Smoothing attempts to reduce these artifacts.
                           Smoothing is really only necessary at very low
                           quality settings (less than 10); even then the
                           effects of smoothing are not particularly
                           significant.

          Examples         Convert the file photo.tga to a JPEG file called

                           The Pictor format was designed so that an image
                           could be loaded into an IBM graphics adapter
                           very quickly; it does this by almost exactly
                           duplicating the organization of the graphics
                           adapter memory.  This makes the format hardware
                           dependent.

          Comments         Some Pictor files do not contain palettes.  For
                           those files Alchemy will default to using a
                           standard palette appropriate to the display mode
                           the file was saved in.  However, the image may
                           not use the default palette; in that case you
                           can read the palette from another file with the
                           -F false colour option.

                           PCX files are used extensively by MS-DOS
                           machines.  Originally created by ZSoft for use
                           by their paint packages, PCX files can be read
                           and written by almost all MS-DOS paint software
                           and desktop publishing software.

                           A new variation of PCX file, DCX, is used by
                           many MS-DOS fax boards.

                           PCX files suffer from two problems:  the
                           compression ratio is poor for 8 and 24 bit
                           images and PCX files are often written out
                           incorrectly; see the Limitations section below
                           for details.

                           Most paint and desktop publishing software can
                           read and write PCX files.
                           Fax board software uses the DCX variation of
                           PCX.

          Variations       1, 4, 8, and 24 bits per pixel for standard PCX

                           1 bit per pixel for DCX files.

          Limitations      PCX format files are often written out
                           incorrectly; Alchemy attempts to figure out what
                           is wrong and make intelligent decisions (things
                           Alchemy can deal with include PCX files without
                           palettes, files missing the last line of image
                           data, and files with illegal (and incorrect)
                           combinations of bits per pixel and planes).

                           24 bit PCX files are very new and most other
                           software can not read them.  Therefore, unless
                           you are sure that the software you are using can
                           read a 24 bit PCX file, you probably want to use
                           the -8 option to force Alchemy to write a
                           paletted file when generating a PCX file.

                           DCX files are multiple page PCX images which are
                           used by various manufacturers of fax boards and
                           fax software.  Alchemy only reads the first page
                           of a DCX file.  Alchemy always writes single
                           page DCX files which are black and white.

          Comments         Because so many software packages can read and
                           write PCX files we are especially interested in
                           supporting as many variations as possible.  If
                           you have any PCX files which Alchemy does not
                           read correctly please contact us.

                           Since DCX files are always 1 bit, black and
                           white images, Alchemy assumes the use of
                           -b -c2 -8 when writing the DCX variation of PCX.

                           ZSoft recently changed some of the information
                           in the header of PCX files so they now include
                           image resolution.  Some fax board software makes
                           use of this information when transmitting PCX or
                           DCX files as faxes.  See the example section
                           below for an example of how to specify image
                           resolution when writing a PCX file.

          Related options  -D   Specify image resolution.

          Example          Convert the GIF file, lush.gif, to a PCX file:

          Comments         Q0 files are actually two files, one with the
                           extension .rgb or .q0 and the other with the
                           extension .fal.  The .rgb or .q0 file contains
                           the actual image data and the .fal file contains
                           the header information (primarily the height and
                           width of the image).  You specify the name of
                           the .rgb or .q0 file and Alchemy automatically
                           generates the name of the .fal file.

                           When writing a Q0 file Alchemy will overwrite,
                           without warning, existing .fal files.

          Example          Convert the file dogcow.gif to a Q0 file:

                                alchemy dogcow.gif --q

          Variations       QDV files are always 8 bits per pixel.

          Comments         Giffer is a great shareware (Beerwaretm,
                           actually) program for the Macintosh that
                           converts between various image file formats and
                           allows viewing of graphics files.

                           Since QDV files are always paletted, Alchemy
                           assumes the use of the -8 option when writing
                           QDV files.

          Example          Convert the file input.tga to a qdv file:

                                alchemy input.tga --D

          Comments         The image should be scaled up to either
                           2000x1366 or 4000x2732 to fill the slide.

                           There are some limitations with the current
                           version of the MVP software driver supplied by
                           Agfa/Matrix:

                           24 bit Scodl files are not correctly interpreted
                           by the MVP driver version 4.1 and earlier.  8
                           bit images are correctly interpreted.

                           When sending very large images to the background
                           MVP driver you must be using version 4.0 or
                           later and have lots of EMS memory (4 Megabytes
                           is recommended).  When using the foreground MVP
                           program turning on disk caching is necessary.

          Example          Convert the file picture.im32 to a Scodl file
                           using high quality scaling and preserving the
                           aspect ratio:

          Limitations      Alchemy can't write paletted files with more
                           than 256 colours.

                           When reading paletted files with more than 256
                           colours they are treated as true colour.

          Comments         Stork images are stored in two or three files
                           (depending on whether or not there's a colour
                           lookup table associated with the image).  The
                           filename given to Alchemy should be the name of
                           the data file (normally with a suffix of .pre);
                           Alchemy will generate the names of the other
                           files by stripping the extension and appending
                           .idx for the index file and .tab for the colour
                           lookup table (if any).  Alchemy will overwrite

          Limitations      For a short time a version of the PBM toolkit
                           wrote Sun Raster files which had the wrong RGB
                           order.  Unfortunately there seem to be many
                           images which were generated with this incorrect
                           RGB order.  Please be aware that Alchemy's Sun
                           Raster reading and writing capability has been
                           extensively tested and compared to various other
                           tools; the RGB order is correct.

          Comments         Sun Raster files are normally not compressed and
                           so take up lots of disk space.

                           There is no standard extension for Sun Raster
                           files; the extensions that Alchemy uses seem to
                           be the most common.

          Example          Convert the SGI file sgiout to a sun raster file
                           called sun.im8:

                                alchemy -s sgiout sun.im8

          Variations       Reads 8, 15, 16, 24, and 32 bit images, ignoring
                           the alpha channel for 32 bit images.

                           Writes 8, 15, 16, 24, and 32 bit images, writing
                           an empty alpha channel for 32 bit images.

          Comments         15 and 16 bit output are actually the same
                           except for one field in the header.

                           Targa files allow a footer containing additional
                           information such as aspect ratio.  However some
                           software is unable to read Targa files which
                           have a footer, so Alchemy allows all valid
                           combinations to be written.  The most common
                           variant for software to be able to read is 24
                           bit uncompressed (specify -a0 and -24).

          Example          Convert the file input.tif to an uncompressed 24
                           bit Targa file:

                                alchemy input.tif -a -24

                           Convert the file input.tif to an uncompressed 15
                           bit Targa file called output.tga with no footer:

                           images for various workstations.  The source

          Used by          Utah RLE toolkit

          Variations       Reads and writes 1 and 3 channel 8 bits per
                           pixel files; the Alpha Channel is ignored during
                           reading.

          Limitations      While reading, files which are 1 channel and
                           have either no colour map or a single channel
                           colour map are assumed to be gray-scale images.
                           The colour map, if present, will be used as a
                           gamma correction table.

                           Files which are 1 channel and have a 3 channel
                           colour map are assumed to be paletted colour
                           files.

                           Files which are 3 channel are assumed to be true
                           colour.

                           When writing RLE files Alchemy will generate a 1
                           channel file with a 3 channel colour map for
                           paletted images and a 3 channel file with no
                           colour map for true colour images.

          Comments         Alchemy does not write optimally compressed
                           images.

          Limitations      Several of the programs which read and write RLE
                           files do not do so correctly; we do not
                           recommend writing RLE files unless you have
                           verified that they work with your intended
                           application.

                           If you are converting an image to use as
                           wallpaper on a 16 colour Windows display you
                           will want to match the palette of the output
                           image to one of the existing 16 colour BMP
                           images supplied with Windows (chess.bmp, for
                           example).  If you do not do this the wallpaper
                           will not be loaded correctly.  See the example

                           files.  Since adding a C preprocessor to Alchemy
                           to handle all the theoretically allowable .xbm
                           files is impractical we have instead designed
                           Alchemy to interchange .xbm files with the PBM
                           utilities and the X supplied utilities, and to
                           read the sample .xbm files from Sun
                           Microsystems.  If you run across any .xbm files

          Comments         Most of the X supplied utilities (bitmap, for

                           being performed.  On MS-DOS based systems this
                           will usually allow conversion of larger images
                           than would otherwise be possible.  On Unix
                           systems this may reduce paging when converting
                           very large images.

          Example          Convert the image giant.tga to a 16 colour TIFF
                           file conserving memory:

                                alchemy giant.tga -$ -t -c16

          Purpose          Disable automatic appending of the output image

          Comments         By default, if there's no '.' in the output
                           filename, Alchemy will add an extension
                           indicating the type of file.  If the -. option
                           is specified no extension will be added.

                           This is most useful on non-MS-DOS systems where
                           '.' is not a special character in filenames.

          Example          Convert the file called infile.gif to a PCX file

                           Alchemy would automatically change the output

          Purpose          Allow the conversion of multiple files with a
                           single execution of Alchemy.

          Syntax           -- (dash)

          Comments         The wildcard option allows you to specify
                           multiple file names and file names which include
                           wild card characters.  Alchemy will perform the
                           same conversion for each input file name that it
                           finds.

                           On MS-DOS systems the use of the wildcard option
                           (--) is not required if the first file name
                           specified includes a wildcard character (* or
                           ?); however to reduce confusion it is still
                           recommended.

          Limitations      The wildcard option (--) must be specified
                           before any file names.

                           If you are using the wildcard option you may not
                           specify an output file name;  the file names are
                           automatically generated by substituting an
                           appropriate extension to the input file names.
                           If you do specify an output file name it will be
                           misinterpreted as another input file.  An output
                           path name may still be specified.

                           Any error will terminate the execution of
                           Alchemy; any images which appear in the filename
                           list after the one causing the error will not be
                           processed.  This includes attempting to
                           overwrite an already existing file without
                           specifying the -o option.

                           Alchemy does not intelligently retain
                           information between files.  For example, if you
                           are matching a group of files to an existing
                           palette, the inverse palette generation step
                           only needs to be performed once, but it is in
                           fact done for each file.  This only affects the
                           speed of conversions, not the quality.

          Introduction     Colour and Palette options are options which
                           affect the appearance of the output image.  They
                           control such things as the number of colours in
                           the output image and the dithering techniques
                           used.

          Purpose          Convert the image to black and white.

          Syntax           -b

          Comments         In conjunction with the -b option the -c option
                           is used to specify the number of shades of gray
                           in the image.  The default is 256 shades of gray
                           when converting from a true colour image.  When
                           converting from a paletted image the number of
                           shades of gray defaults to the number of colours
                           in the original image.

                           The shades of gray are uniformly distributed
                           from 0 to 255.

                           When converting from true colour the image will
                           be changed to a paletted image unless the -24
                           option is used.

          Comments         If the input file has a larger number of colours
                           than specified for the output file, the image
                           will be quantized using Heckbert's median cut
                           algorithm and dithered.  For further information
                           on Heckbert's median cut algorithm see Appendix
                           B, Colour and Dithering.

                           The number of colours to reserve is an optional
                           parameter.  If it is present it causes the
                           specified number of colours to be reserved from
                           the beginning of the palette.  The output image
                           will not contain any of those colour indices.
                           This can be useful if you have menus or other
                           information you wish to display at the same time
                           as the images and they use colours at the
                           beginning of the palette.  The menu colours will
                           then not interfere with the image.  The first
                           indices are set to black unless 16 is specified,
                           in which case they are set to the standard VGA
                           colour palette.

          Limitations      Specifying the number of colours only has an
                           effect if you are writing a paletted file (using
                           the -8 option) or if the output file type is
                           always paletted.

                           Converting an image with a large number of
                           colours to a small number of colours (less than
                           8) will usually give poor results.

                           The reserved colours will be set to black unless
                           16 colours are reserved.  In that case they will
                           be set to the standard VGA colours.

          Purpose          Specifies the type of dithering to apply to the

                                3:Jarvis, Judice, & Ninke
                           The default is Floyd-Steinberg.

                           perturbation
                                0 through 127
                           The default is 0.

          Comments         Dithering is used to reduce colour banding in an
                           image caused by the palette not having a perfect
                           match for every colour in the image.

                           Floyd-Steinberg is the fastest supported
                           dithering algorithm and usually produces the
                           best results.  Stucki and Jarvis, Judice, &
                           Ninke both tend to cause an image to appear more
                           grainy on low resolution output devices (such as
                           CRTs).  However they produce better results than
                           Floyd-Steinberg on high-resolution, low colour
                           output devices such as laser printers.

                           The -d option only has an effect if the number
                           of colours is being reduced or the image is
                           being re-mapped to a new palette.

                           Specifying a perturbation adds noise to the
                           threshold used for dithering, which can help
                           break up visible patterns introduced by
                           dithering.  The parameter specifies the
                           magnitude of the noise.

                           Using a serpentine raster can also help to
                           reduce visible patterns introduced by dithering.

                           For further information on dithering see

          Purpose          Optimize the image quality for display on an EGA
                           board and monitor.

          Syntax           -E

          Comments         If you are converting images to display on an
                           EGA board and monitor this option will optimize
                           the image quality.

                           This option reduces the palette resolution to
                           two bits and automatically specifies the
                           following:  -8 -c16 -z0 2 0.

          Limitations      The number of colours in an EGA palette must be
                           less than or equal to 16;  the number of colours
                           defaults to 16 but can be reduced by using the -
                           c option.

                           the palette found in the specified filename but
                           no attempt at picking the best match will be
                           done.

                           palette

          Comments         This feature can be used to add false colour to
                           monochrome images.  The output file is not
                           dithered.  This is only applicable to paletted
                           input files.

          Syntax           -f filename

          Parameter        filename

                           palette

          Comments         Using the -f option will cause the output image
                           to be dithered (unless you specify no dithering
                           by using the -d0 option).

                           The -f option can be useful if you are combining
                           several images into a collage or want to match
                           an image to a pre-existing palette.  You can
                           also create a custom palette from scratch by
                           using a text editor and creating a .PAL file.

          Limitations      Cannot be combined with spiff -S or false colour
                           -F.

                           The number of colours in the final image will be
                           equal to the number of colours in the palette
                           being read in.

                           The specified file must contain a palette (i.e.

          Purpose          Force the output image to be paletted.

          Syntax           -8

          Comments         This option is -8 because paletted images are
                           typically 8 bits per pixel.

                           Alchemy defaults to the -8 option if the input
                           file is paletted or gray-scale.

                           Some file formats require files to be paletted;
                           for those formats the -8 option is assumed.
                           Some file formats do not have a paletted
                           variation; in those cases the -8 option will be
                           ignored if specified.  Some file formats only
                           allow gray-scale files to be 8 bit; in those
                           cases Alchemy will ignore the -8 option if the
                           image being written is not gray-scale.

                           The actual number of bits per pixel is
                           determined by the -c option (below).

                           If the input file is true colour the output file
                           will be quantized and dithered (see the -c and -

          Purpose          Control how the palette is generated.  These
                           options only have an effect if the palette is
                           being generated by Alchemy using Heckbert's
                           median cut algorithm.

          Syntax           -z sortType [selectionType [swapType] ]

          Parameters       Sort the image palette.  SortType can be:
                                0:None
                                1:popularity
                                2:luminance (white to black)
                                3:rgb
                                4:luminance (black to white)
                           The default is None.

                           SelectionType can be:
                                0:mean
                                1:median
                                2:corner
                           The default is mean.

                           See Appendix B, Colour and Dithering, for an
                           explanation of these choices.

                           SwapType can be:
                                0:None
                                1:IBM (colour 0 is black, 7 is white)
                                2:Macintosh (colour 0 is white, 255 is
                           black)
                                3:Sun (colour 0 is white, 1 is black)
                           The default is based on the file type being
                           written out (IBM for GIF, Macintosh for Mac
                           PICT, Sun for Sun Raster, and None for all
                           others).

          Comments         The most common use for this option is to sort
                           the palette; in this case only a single
                           parameter is needed.

                           This option only affects palettes that are
                           generated by Alchemy.  To sort an existing
                           palette you can save the image as a true colour
                           file (such as HSI Raw, by using the -24 -r
                           options) and then convert that back to a
                           paletted file, specifying the desired sort type.
                           In most cases this will not change the image
                           (other than the palette order); however if the
                           palette had entries representing colours that
                           are nearly identical then the image may be
                           modified.

          Limitations      Note that it is not possible to specify a
                           swapType without first specifying both a
                           sortType and a selectionType.  See Appendix B,
                           Colour and Dithering, for more information.

          Example          Convert the file input.tga to a gif filed called
                           output.gif sorting the colours by luminance,
                           using the mean of the Heckbert box for the
                           colour, and moving the colours around so that
                           the lightest colour is colour 0 and the darkest
                           colour is colour 1.

          Purpose          Enhance the image contrast by stretching the
                           pixel colour values to the full 0 to 255 range.

          Syntax           -S

          Comments         This command can be used if the image you are
                           converting is shifted in brightness or squished
                           in contrast.  This can happen if you scan or
                           digitize a very dark or very bright image.

          Limitations      The -S option can not be used at the same time
                           as the -b option when converting from a true
                           colour image.  A work around is to do the
                           operation in two steps, converting it to black
                           and white first and then spiffing the resulting
                           image.

                           Using the spiff option at the same time as the
                           match palette, -f, or false colour, -F, options
                           is not allowed.  This is because the spiff
                           option would be performed before the palette is
                           changed, which would nullify the effects.  A
                           work around is to do the matching or false
                           colouring first, and then spiff the resultant
                           image.

          Related options  -b   Black and White

          True Colour (24 bits)                                         -24


          Purpose          Force the output image to be true colour (not
                           paletted).

          Syntax           -24

          Comments         This option is -24 because true colour images
                           are typically 24 bits per pixel.

                           Some file formats require files to be true
                           colour; for those formats the -24 option is
                           assumed.  Some file formats only have a paletted
                           variation; in those cases the -24 option will be
                           ignored if specified.

                           The file formats which may be either true colour
                           or paletted default to true colour if the input
                           file is true colour.

                           Certain file formats may only be paletted if the
                           images are gray-scale, in those cases Alchemy
                           will automatically switch to true colour if the
                           output image is colour.

                           Converting a paletted image to true colour will
                           not improve its quality or change its
                           appearance.  The primary use of this option is
                           to force an image to be true colour when
                           converting to a format which allows either
                           paletted or true colour, but where the paletted
                           variation is not well supported (like the Targa
                           image format).

          Uniform Palette                                                -u


          Purpose          Use a Uniform Palette.

          Syntax           -u

          Comments         Instead of using the Heckbert median cut
                           algorithm to generate a custom palette for the
                           image, use a palette with entries which are
                           evenly distributed in the RGB colour cube.

                           The advantage of using a uniform palette is that
                           it's faster than generating a custom palette.
                           However, this is at the expense of image quality
                           since the palette isn't generated based on image
                           content.

                           When just viewing a true colour image on a
                           paletted display a uniform palette is used.

                           The -c option can be used in conjunction with -u
                           to specify the size of the uniform palette; in
                           that case Alchemy will generate a palette with
                           not more than the specified number of colours
                           (but not less than 8).

          Limitations      The palette size will not necessarily match the
                           specified size, as the actual size must be the
                           product of three integers.  Alchemy picks
                           integers that roughly correspond to the
                           sensitivity of the human eye to red, green, and
                           blue (30%, 59%, and 11%).

          Introduction     These options are all related to image scaling.
                           Note that the -D option does not actually change
                           the size of the image, it specifies an aspect
                           ratio or image resolution to be placed in the
                           header of the output image.

          Syntax           -+ (plus)

          Comments         If specified with either the -X or -Y option
                           Alchemy will choose the other dimension to
                           preserve the aspect ratio of the image.

                           If specified in conjunction with both -X and -Y
                           Alchemy will use the values specified as a
                           bounding box, reducing one dimension if
                           necessary to preserve the image aspect ratio.

          Limitations      Does not pay attention to the pixel aspect ratio
                           values in the input image.

          Examples         Change the size of the image toobig.gif so that
                           the width is 640 and the height is the correct
                           number to preserve the aspect ratio of the image
                           (the new image will be called notbig.gif):

                                alchemy -X640 -+ toobig.gif -g notbig

                           Do the same thing but guarantee that the image
                           will not be larger than 640 by 480:

          Scale Image in Horizontal Direction                            -X


          Purpose          Scale the horizontal dimension of the image to
                           the specified number of pixels.

          Syntax           -X[scaleType] pixels

          Parameters       scaleType
                                The type of scaling to use:
                                   a: nearest neighbor
                                   b: averaging/linear interpolation
                                   c: lanczos2
                                   d: lanczos3
                                scaleType is optional; the default is
                           nearest neighbor.  The higher the scale type the
                           higher the quality (and the longer the
                           processing time).

                           pixels
                                The number of pixels in the output image in
                           the horizontal dimension.

          Comments         Nearest neighbor type scaling is faster than the
                           other types but introduces aliasing (which
                           reduces image quality).  The highest quality
                           scaling supported is lanczos3, but it takes much
                           longer than averaging/linear interpolation and
                           generally doesn't produce significantly better
                           results.

          Limitations      All of the scale types other than nearest
                           neighbor give much better results than nearest
                           neighbor scaling, but they are slower and
                           require a new palette to be generated for
                           paletted output files (you can force alchemy to
                           use the original palette by using the -f option
                           and specifying the original image as the palette

          Specify Image Aspect Ratio                                     -D


          Purpose          Specify aspect ratio for the output image.

          Syntax           -D aspectRatio

          Parameter        aspectRatio
                                The percentage of the width of a pixel to
                           its height.

          Comments         This option does not actually change the aspect
                           ratio of the image, it just adds the aspect
                           ratio value to the output file.  This is
                           important when trying to export the image to
                           software which expects this information.

                           The aspect ratio of an image is the ratio of the
                           width of a single pixel to the height of a
                           single pixel.  (So to specify an aspect ratio of
                           5:6 use -D 83, since (5/6)*100 is 83).

                           Alchemy attempts to preserve the aspect ratio
                           value when converting images whenever one is
                           found in the input image, but since so few file
                           formats have aspect ratio information this
                           hardly ever happens.

                           This option can also be used when displaying an
                           image on an IBM PC.

          Limitations      It is not possible to specify both an aspect
                           ratio and a dots per inch value for an image.
                           This is because specifying a dots per inch value
                           automatically implies an aspect ratio.

                           Many file types do not have an aspect ratio
                           value, so specifying one will have no effect.

          Related options  -D   Specify resolution

          Examples         You are converting a 640x350 IBM EGA PCX image
                           called ega.pcx (which has an aspect ratio of
                           35:48) to a TIFF image and you want the TIFF
                           image to have the correct aspect ratio value (so
                           that an intelligent TIFF reader will correctly
                           interpret the image) (Note that the value of 73
                           is (35/48)*100):

                           The resulting image will still be 640x350, but
                           the TIFF file now contains the information that
                           the pixels are not square (and in fact are
                           35:48).

                           If you had instead wanted to convert the image
                           to a 640 by 480 image (with square pixels) you
                           could have used:

                                alchemy ega.pcx -Y480 -D100 -t

                           The -D option isn't really needed here, since
                           any software reading the TIFF file will assume
                           that if there is no aspect ratio specified the
                           pixels are square.

                           resolution of the image, it just adds the
                           resolution fields to the output image.  This is
                           important when trying to import the image into
                           software which expects this information.  For
                           example, Microsoft Word is much more likely to
                           give the expected results when importing a TIFF
                           image for printing on a laser printer if the
                           image has a resolution of 300 dpi.

                           Reasonable values to use for dotsPerInch include
                           72 (the resolution of a 13 inch monitor
                           displaying 640x480) and 300 (the resolution of a
                           laser printer).

                           Alchemy will preserve this information when
                           converting files whenever possible.



          Limitations      It is not possible to specify both an aspect
                           ratio and a dots per inch value for an image.
                           This is because specifying a dots per inch value
                           automatically implies an aspect ratio.

                           This option is ignored when writing a file
                           format which does not have image resolution.

                           Image Alchemy can display images.

                           Depending on the hardware installed Alchemy
                           supports 320x200x256, 360x480x256, 640x400x256,

                           Alchemy automatically detects which type of
                           display board you have installed.  If there are
                           multiple display boards installed in one
                           computer then Alchemy will display images on the
                           first board it finds,  searching in the
                           following order:

          Western Digital  8514/A boards which are equipped with the
                   8514/A  Western Digital chipset are automatically
                           recognized by Alchemy.  Depending on the model
                           board and the amount of memory installed,

                AI 8514/A  Alchemy requires AI to be installed to use
                           8514/A displays which aren't based on the
                           Western Digital chipset.  In addition to 8514/A
                           boards Alchemy should also be able to display on
                           other AI compatible boards, such as 340x0 based
                           boards; however this has not been tested.  For
                           AI based boards the only resolution available is
                           1024x768x256

                     VESA  The best support for SVGA boards is available
                           for VESA compatible SVGA boards.  VESA is a SVGA
                           standard which allows applications software,
                           such as Image Alchemy, to interrogate the SVGA
                           board to determine which display modes are
                           available.  Some SVGA boards have VESA support
                           built directly into the BIOS found on the board;
                           in this case Alchemy will automatically detect
                           the VESA driver and use it.  Other SVGA boards
                           require a software driver to be installed;
                           these drivers are usually found on the floppy
                           disks which came with your SVGA board (typically
                           the driver is called VESA.EXE).  If you can't
                           find a driver on the diskettes and the
                           documentation does not explicitly mention that
                           VESA support is built into the BIOS you might
                           call the manufacturer to see if a VESA driver is
                           available.  VESA drivers are currently available
                           for VGA boards using chipsets from Cirrus Logic,
                           ATI Technologies, Chips and Technologies, Everex
                           Systems, Genoa Systems, Paradise Logic, Sigma
                           Designs, STB Systems, Tecmar, Headland
                           Technology (Video 7), Orchid Technology, Appian
                           Technology, Trident Microsystems, and Oak
                           Technology.

               Other SVGA  If Alchemy cannot find a VESA SVGA board it
                           attempts to determine what kind of SVGA board is
                           present.

                           The 320x200x256 mode is a standard IBM VGA mode
                           and will work on all VGA boards.  The
                           360x480x256 is a non-standard VGA mode which
                           should also work on all VGA boards.

                           Because of various incompatibilities between
                           different VGA boards 640x400x256 and/or
                           640x480x256 modes are not supported on some VGA
                           boards.  VGA boards which have been tested for
                           the higher resolution modes include Paradise,
                           Tseng Labs 3000 & 4000, Video 7, Trident, and
                           Everex chipset based VGA Boards.

                           parameter may follow the -v command.  This
                           parameter specifies horizontal resolution and
                           may be 320, 360, 640, 800, 1024, or 1280.  The
                           default is to use the lowest resolution which
                           can fit the entire image.

                           If the image is true colour, a uniform palette
                           will be used and the image will be dithered

          Comments         This command will scale the image and correct
                           the aspect ratio of the image by removing rows
                           and/or columns from the image.

                           Note that this option can also be useful for
                           displaying images which are not larger than the
                           screen but which have an aspect ratio different
                           than the display.

          Limitations      Alchemy assumes that the aspect ratio of a
                           display pixel is 1:1 when in 640x480, 800x600,
                           1024x768, and 1280x1024 modes, 5:6 when in
                           640x400 mode and 320x200 modes, and 16:9 in
                           360x480 mode.

                           If not otherwise specified by using the -D
                           option or in the file, Alchemy assumes that the
                           aspect ratio of pixels in 640x400 images and
                           320x200 images is 5:6 and the aspect ratio of
                           pixels in 640x350 images is 35:48.  You can
                           override any of these assumptions with the -D
                           option.

                           Don't worry if this is confusing;  in practice
                           Alchemy deals with everything automatically if
                           you use the -V option.  However, there is a
                           problem with displaying 320x400 IFF files; see

                  Question When I view a JPEG compressed image on my VGA
                           board it looks much worse than when I first
                           convert it to a GIF file and then view it.  Why
                           is this?

                    Answer To save time Alchemy automatically uses a
                           uniform palette when you are just viewing a true
                           colour image.  When converting to a different
                           file format Alchemy uses Heckbert quantization
                           to generate a palette.  The difference in image
                           quality is the difference between using a
                           uniform palette and an optimum palette.  See
                           Appendix B, Colour and Dithering, for more
                           information on palette generation.


                  Question Why can't my paint package read the Targa file I
                           wrote with Image Alchemy?

                    Answer Some software which reads Targa files can not
                           handle compressed files.  In addition, some
                           software can read true colour Targa files, but
                           can not read paletted or gray-scale files.
                           Image Alchemy can be forced to write out a true
                           colour file by using the -24 option.


                  Question I told Alchemy to convert a PCX file to an 8 bit
                           GIF file (using the -8 option).  Yet when I get
                           statistics on the file (using -x) Alchemy
                           reports the file only has 16 colours.

                    Answer Alchemy will always store the file using the
                           smallest bits-per-pixel allowable for the given
                           image (this results in the smallest possible
                           file).  In this case the input file only had 16
                           colours in it.

                           Things get more unpredictable with formats such
                           as Sun Raster (which requires 1 bit files to be
                           black and white) and SGI (which requires 8 bit
                           files to be gray-scale).  In these cases Alchemy
                           will always do the best it can (giving you a
                           warning message if it does something which may
                           surprise you later).


                  Question Why is decompressing or compressing a JPEG image
                           so slow?

                    Answer There are a large number of calculations that
                           have to be done during JPEG compression.  This
                           is an inherent limitation of JPEG compression.
                           Image Alchemy has been optimized quite a bit to
                           reduce the number of calculations, and we are
                           working to further reduce the number of
                           calculations.  If you are transferring files
                           over modems or storing them on slow media (tape)
                           the compression times are usually more than made
                           up for by the decrease in transmission or
                           retrieval times.


                  Question Why can't my favorite desktop publishing package
                           read the TIFF file I wrote with Image Alchemy?

                    Answer TIFF is an extremely versatile standard; it can
                           handle anything from 1 bit images to full colour
                           images with an alpha channel.  Also, TIFF allows
                           many different types of compression.
                           Unfortunately this versatility means that it's
                           difficult for a single piece of software to be
                           able to read in every valid TIFF file.

                           If the software specifies the classes of TIFF it
                           can read, you can force Alchemy to write out a
                           specific TIFF class by using the following
                           options:
                              class B: -8 -b -c2 -t2
                              class G: -8 -b -t1
                              class P: -8 -t1
                              class R: -24 -t1

                           Class B is black and white, Class G is gray-
                           scale, Class P is paletted, and Class R is true
                           colour.

                           If the supported classes are not specified
                           experiment with various combinations of -24, -8,
                           -b, and -c.  In this case it is usually best to
                           use no compression (-t0) while experimenting
                           with the other options, as many TIFF readers
                           have difficulty with compressed files.  When you
                           find a set of options that work, then you can
                           try various compression modes to save space.  Be
                           aware that using the -b option will force the
                           output file to be gray-scale and you will lose
                           the colour information in the file (most DTP
                           programs only have support for gray-scale TIFF
                           files).

                           You may also have to use the -Dn n option to
                           specify the resolution of the image (this is
                           especially true when converting from a file
                           format which does not have a value for image
                           resolution).  You can generally tell if this is
                           necessary because the program you are using to
                           read in the TIFF file will claim that the file
                           is unreasonably large or small.  Generally, if
                           you are using a 300 DPI Laser Printer you want
                           to make the TIFF file 300DPI x 300DPI (-
                           D 300 300).

                           If you would like further information specific
                           to using Image Alchemy with your word processor
                           or desktop publishing program please contact us;
                           we will be maintaining a list of how to make
                           Alchemy work with other software packages.
                           Similarly if you figure out how to import files
                           into a specific package let us know and we will

                  Question I've converted a Mac PICT file to a GIF file,
                           but the GIF file is missing some or all of the
                           information that was in the PICT file.  What
                           happened to it?

                    Answer PICT files are a combination of drawing commands
                           (such as lines, rectangles, and circles) and
                           raster areas (called pixMaps).  Alchemy can only
                           read the raster portions of the files.  Programs
                           such as MacDraw and MacDraft write out files
                           with drawing commands, programs such as MacPaint
                           write out files which are entirely raster areas
                           (pixMaps), and some programs, such as SuperPaint
                           can write out files which are either or a
                           combination of both.  If you are using such a
                           program check the documentation on how to write
                           out files in "paint" mode.


                  Question When I convert a GIF file to a JPEG file and
                           then back to a GIF file the final GIF file is
                           twice the size of the original.  Why is this?

                    Answer There are two things which might cause this to
                           happen:

                           JPEG compression doesn't really work well for
                           images which have large areas which are all the
                           same colour.  The reason for this is that JPEG
                           is a lossy compression technique.  Therefore you
                           are not going to get back exactly the same
                           values for each pixel in an area that was one
                           solid colour before being JPEG compressed.  But
                           GIF compression works much better on areas which
                           are one solid colour, so, when you GIF compress
                           these areas, they are quite a bit larger than
                           they were before.  The solution to this problem
                           is to use HSI JPEG compression, which
                           automatically detects large areas of solid
                           colours and does not JPEG compress them.  The
                           problem with HSI JPEG compression is that it
                           isn't compatible with JPEG or JFIF.

                           The other possibility is that the input GIF file
                           didn't have very many different colours.  When
                           you converted it to a JPEG file the number of
                           colours in the file was lost (JPEG gray-scale
                           files always use 256 shades, and JPEG colour
                           files are always true colour).  When the JPEG
                           file was converted back to a GIF file Alchemy
                           assumed you wanted 256 colours in the file, and
                           a 256 colour GIF file is bigger than a 16 colour
                           GIF file.  To prevent this you can use a -c32
                           (or however many colours the original had)
                           option in the command line; this forces Image
                           Alchemy to use that many colours for the output
                           file.


                  Question I keep getting "Out of Memory trying to ..."
                           messages.  Help!

                    Answer Image Alchemy is running out of memory.  First
                           try to do the conversion again with the -$
                           (conserve memory) option.  Next, if that doesn't
                           help, attempt to maximize the amount of memory
                           available by removing as many memory resident
                           programs as you can.  If this still doesn't help
                           please contact us with the following
                           information: your computer configuration (amount
                           of available memory, size of hard disk),
                           operating system version, and what you are
                           trying to do (input file information (size of
                           image and type of file) and options specified).
                           Alchemy can generally convert images as larger
                           than 2000 pixels wide and a virtually unlimited
                           number of pixels tall.  However there are
                           certain conversions which require more memory
                           than others.


                  Question I am using Alchemy to display a 320x400 IFF
                           image created by an Amiga.  When I use just the
                           -v option the image comes out tall and skinny.
                           When I use the -V option, which is supposed to
                           correct the aspect ratio, things get worse
                           instead of better (the image is even skinnier).
                           What's going on?

                    Answer As near as we can tell, some Amiga software has
                           a different idea of what aspect ratio is than
                           the rest of the world.

                           For displays aspect ratio is defined as the
                           ratio of the width of a single pixel to the
                           height of a single pixel.  So if you have square
                           pixels (which you do on a standard monitor in
                           640x480 mode) the aspect ratio is 1 to 1
                           (commonly written as 1:1).  When you change
                           display modes the height and width of the total
                           display area does not change; what is changing
                           is the width and height of each pixel, which
                           means that the aspect ratio changes.  For
                           example, a 640x400 display has an aspect ratio
                           of 1:1.2 (that means each pixel is 1.2 times as
                           tall as it is wide (which makes sense since
                           480/400 equals 1.2)).  A 640x200 display
                           (remember IBM CGA graphics mode?) has an aspect
                           ratio of 1:2.4.

                           Now this is where it gets interesting in terms
                           of IFF files.  The aspect ratio number stored in
                           Amiga IFF files for 320x400 images is 1:1.1,
                           meaning pixels are 1.1 times as tall as they are
                           wide, so therefore the actual image should be
                           the equivalent size of a 320x440 image with
                           square pixels.  And this is what Alchemy will
                           attempt to display when you use the -V option
                           (Alchemy never makes any dimension larger, so
                           the actual image Alchemy displays is 291x400,
                           which is the same ratio as 320x440).  However
                           this is obviously wrong, as you can tell when
                           you examine an image.  As near as we can tell
                           the correct aspect ratio of these images is 5:3
                           (the math we used to come up with this number is
                           640/320:480/400).  And if you tell Alchemy to
                           override the aspect ratio by using a -D 167
                           option (167 because 5/3*100 is 166.6666) the
                           image displays correctly.  Why Amigas create
                           images which claim they are 1:1.1 remains a
                           mystery.

                  Question When I convert a 32 bit Targa file to a GIF file
                           and then to a JPEG file it doesn't look nearly
                           as good as if I convert the Targa File directly
                           to the JPEG file.  What can I do to maintain
                           high quality in JPEG compressed files?

                    Answer When the Targa file was converted to the GIF
                           file Image Alchemy had to reduce the number of
                           colours in the file (the original Targa File had
                           up to 16 million colours, GIF files are limited
                           to 256 colours).  This step is known as colour
                           quantization (Image Alchemy uses the Heckbert
                           Median Cut method for quantization, see Appendix
                           B, Colour and Dithering, for more information).
                           The difficulty with colour quantization is that
                           it leaves artifacts known as colour banding.  To
                           reduce this phenomenon Image Alchemy dithers the
                           image (you can see the effect of colour banding
                           by turning off dithering by using the -d0
                           option).  Unfortunately a dithered image does
                           not JPEG compress very well (dithering adds a
                           lot of high-frequency information to an image;
                           JPEG compression attempts to remove much of that
                           information).  In addition JPEG images are
                           always continuous colour images, so when the
                           JPEG file is decompressed it has to be colour
                           quantized and dithered again.  Dithering a
                           previously dithered image reduces the quality
                           even more.  The solution is to use the best
                           starting quality you can for JPEG compression,
                           ideally a continuous tone image.  The compressed
                           image size will be smaller than if you had
                           started with a paletted image and the quality
                           will be better.


                  Question I've converted an HP PCL file to a GIF file, but
                           the GIF file is missing some or all of the
                           information that was in the PCL file.  What
                           happened to it?

                    Answer PCL files have the same problem as PICT files
                           (see above); they are a combination of drawing
                           commands (such as lines and rectangles) and
                           raster areas (called rasters) and Alchemy can
                           only convert the raster areas in PCL files.  PCL
                           Files also contain font and text information,
                           which is also lost.  Unfortunately there isn't
                           any general way to preserve this data with
                           Alchemy.

                           One thing which you can do if running Microsoft
                           Windows 3.0 is to install Adobe Type Manager
                           (ATM).  ATM automatically intercepts any text
                           commands and converts them to rasters.  In
                           addition, the standard Windows 3.0 HP PCL driver
                           only generates rasters, not vectors.  So the
                           file will appear in its entirety when converted
                           by Alchemy.  Contact us if you want further
                           information on using Alchemy with Windows 3.0.


                  Question Why can't Image Alchemy read in JPEG files
                           produced by Kodak's ColorSqueeze (or Sun's
                           VFCtool)?

                    Answer The JPEG standard is still in draft form.  Until
                           it is a mature standard, various manufacturer's
                           will implement different versions of it.  As of
                           March 1, 1991 Image Alchemy supports the JFIF
                           format and should work with any other JPEG
                           software which also claims JFIF compatibility.
                           If other software you are using claims to
                           support the JFIF format and you are having
                           trouble please contact us.  If the other
                           software does not support JFIF, contact the
                           manufacturer and tell them they should send you
                           an update which does (you can tell them to
                           contact us if they need a copy of the JFIF
                           standard).


                  Question I converted a PCX file with 16 colours to a 16
                           shades of gray TIFF file using the -b and -t
                           options.  The 16 colour PCX file had some shades
                           of gray in it which were changed in the TIFF
                           file.  How can I prevent this?

                    Answer The problem is that gray-scale TIFF files have a
                           uniformly spaced gray palette.  If you create a
                           TIFF file with 16 shades of gray it will have
                           the following shades in it: 0, 17, 34, 51, 68,
                           85, 102, 119, 136, 153, 170, 187, 204, 221, 238,
                           and 255.  However the 16 colour PCX file you
                           started with probably didn't have those exact
                           colours in it (for example, PCX files written
                           out by Windows 3.0 Paint have shades of gray
                           which correspond to 0, 128, 192, and 255).  So
                           Alchemy did the best it could and matched the
                           input colours to the output colours (and
                           depending on the other options that you
                           specified may also have dithered the image).

                           The solution is to tell Alchemy to write out a
                           256 colour gray-scale TIFF file (which you do by
                           adding a -c256 to the -b and -t options).  This
                           file still has a uniform gray palette; but that
                           palette now contains every colour:  0, 1, 2, 3,
                           ..., 255.  Therefore Alchemy can map, for
                           example, the colours 128 and 192 to their exact
                           match.  This does have the disadvantage of
                           making the resulting 256 colour TIFF file twice
                           as large as the 16 colour TIFF file, but this is
                           the only way to guarantee that Alchemy can find
                           an exact match for all the shades of gray in the
                           input file.


                  Question Why do you only allow specifying image
                           resolution in Dots Per Inch?  Don't you realize
                           that most of the world is metric?

                    Answer Yes, we do realize that the entire world, with
                           the exception of the United States and Great
                           Britain, claims to use the metric system
                           exclusively (and Great Britain will presumably
                           change in 1992).  However, this isn't actually
                           true.  A laser printer manufactured in Japan is
                           still 300 dots per inch (not 11.811... dots per
                           mm) and a 19 inch monitor sold in Europe is
                           called a 19 inch monitor (actually a 19 inch
                           monitor is called a 20 inch monitor in Europe,
                           which is a measure of the total picture tube
                           diagonal, not just the viewing area).

          Colour and Dithering
          -----------------------------------------------------------------          -----------------------------------------------------------------


          Paletted vs.     Colour images are normally stored in one of two
          true colour      ways: as an array of direct colour values
                           (usually red, green, and blue) (referred to as a
                           true colour file in this document) or as an
                           array of indices into a colour-map which
                           contains red, green, and blue colour values
                           (referred to as a paletted file in this
                           document).

                           The reason for the existence of paletted images
                           is that they take less memory, so the hardware
                           to display them is less expensive.  The
                           dominance of paletted hardware is changing as
                           the price of memory and the processing power it
                           takes to update large amounts of memory at a
                           reasonable speed drops (a Targa 32 board is an
                           example of a true colour board, a VGA board is
                           an example of a paletted board).

                           Until true colour graphics devices become the
                           norm there's a need to convert images from true
                           colour to paletted.  This conversion is done in
                           two steps: the first is to generate a palette
                           for use by the image;  the second is to map the
                           image to the new palette.

          Colour cube      The colour model generally used by computers is
                           a cube with red, green, and blue as the axes
                           (this is known as a colour cube or RGB cube).
                           Each point inside the cube is a different
                           colour, depending on the amount of red, green,
                           and blue used.  In nature each of the three axes
                           is nearly continuous, therefore there are a
                           nearly infinite number of colours available.
                           Computer hardware and software represent colours
                           in a discrete fashion.

                           For true colour displays or file formats the
                           number of discrete positions along each axis of
                           the colour cube gives the colour resolution of
                           the output device.  For example, a Targa 24
                           board for an IBM PC has 8 bits per red, green,
                           and blue channel for a total of 24 bits (or 256
                           discrete shades of each colour, for a total of
                           16 million colours (256x256x256)).  This is also
                           the colour resolution of most true colour file
                           formats.

                           The new 15 bit SVGA boards have 5 bits per
                           channel, for a total of 32x32x32 different
                           colours (32,768).  This is the same colour
                           resolution as a Targa 15 file.

                           A paletted display or image file has the same
                           colour resolution limit as a true colour display
                           or image file, but in addition there is a limit
                           on how many points inside the cube can be used
                           at the same time.  An 8 bit file format, such as
                           GIF, allows 256 different colours out of 16
                           million.  A normal SVGA board also only allows
                           256 different colours at one time.

                           So, converting a true colour file to a paletted
                           file involves reducing the number of occupied
                           points in the colour cube.  There are several
                           ways this can be done.


          Generating a     Image Alchemy supports two methods of generating
          palette          a palette:

                  Uniform  The simplest and fastest method is to use a
                 palettes  palette containing colours which are uniformly
                           distributed in the RGB cube, referred to as a
                           uniform palette.  This has the advantage that
                           it's fast and the same palette can be used for
                           any image; the primary disadvantage is that most
                           images don't contain colours from everywhere in
                           the RGB cube, so palette entries are wasted
                           representing colours that aren't needed for the
                           particular image being converted.

                  Optimal  To generate a palette which is better for
                 palettes  representing a particular image, Image Alchemy
                           supports Heckbert's median cut algorithm.  This
                           algorithm first builds a three dimensional table
                           (a histogram cube) indicating how popular any
                           given colour in the RGB cube is in the image
                           being converted.  It then proceeds to subdivide
                           this histogram cube (by dividing boxes in half)
                           until it has created as many boxes as there are
                           palette entries.  The decision as to where to
                           divide a box is based on the distribution of
                           colours within the box.  This algorithm attempts
                           to create boxes which have approximately equal
                           popularity in the image.

                           Palette entries are then assigned to represent
                           each box.  There are other methods of generating
                           a palette from an image, but Heckbert's
                           algorithm is generally regarded as the best
                           tradeoff between speed and quality.


            Modifying the  You can change the method used to select a
                  palette  colour to represent each box by use of the -z
                selection  options.
                  process
                           The default method is to use the mean of all the
                           colours in the box.  However for some images
                           slightly better results can be obtained by using
                           the center of the box (without regard to where
                           the pixels are in the box).

                           For images being reduced to a very small number
                           of colours (less than 16) better results can be
                           obtained by using a corner of the box (the boxes
                           tend to be large when reducing an image to a
                           small number of colours; therefore picking
                           colours near the centers of the boxes will give
                           you muddy colours, while using corners of the
                           boxes will give you more saturated colours).



          Mapping the      The next step is to map the image to the new
          image to the     palette; this is where dithering becomes
          palette          important.

             No dithering  The simplest approach is to map every colour in
                           the original image to the palette entry which is
                           closest to it (this is what Image Alchemy does
                           if you specify no dithering).

                           However, since the palette entries generally
                           represent several different colours in the
                           original image, this results in colour banding
                           where areas of smooth colour changes in the
                           original become areas of one solid colour in the
                           paletted version.

            Advantages of  This can be alleviated by dithering the image
                dithering  data such that any given pixel might not be
                           mapped to its closest palette entry, but the
                           average over some area of the image will be
                           closer to the correct colour than it would
                           otherwise be.  Image Alchemy uses a class of
                           algorithms called "error-diffusion" to do
                           dithering.

          Error diffusion  These algorithms work by using the closest
                dithering  palette entry to a colour and then distributing
                           the error (the difference between the desired
                           colour and the chosen palette entry) to the
                           nearby pixels.  This process is repeated for
                           every pixel in the image, using the colour
                           values which have been modified due to the error
                           from previous pixels.  The different dithering
                           algorithms spread the error over a different
                           area or use a different weighting within the
                           same area.

               Serpentine  Error diffusion can be done as a normal raster
                   raster  (left to right, top to bottom) or as a
                           serpentine raster (alternating left to right and
                           right to left, top to bottom).  A serpentine
                           raster tends to break up visible patterns
                           introduced by dithering.

                    Noise  Random noise can also be added to help break up
                           visible patterns in the resulting image.

          What is JPEG Compression?
          -----------------------------------------------------------------          -----------------------------------------------------------------


          Who are those    JPEG stands for the "Joint Photographic Experts
          JPEG guys?       Group".  This is a group of experts who defined
                           a standard compression scheme for still images,
                           commonly called JPEG Compression.  Currently the
                           standard is still in draft form.  The standard
                           should be finalized in 1991.

          Overview         JPEG Compression consists of a series of
                           reasonably complex mathematical operations.
                           These include: colour space conversion, discrete
                           cosine transforms, quantization, and entropy
                           coding.  After these steps you end up with an
                           image which takes fewer bits to store than you
                           started out with.

                           However, when you decompress a JPEG compressed
                           image you end up with an image that is not quite
                           the same as the original  (which is why JPEG
                           Compression is referred to as "lossy").

          Is lossy         You might well ask why anyone would want to
          compression bad? compress an image using a lossy technique.
                           Compression ratios for lossy compression are
                           much better than for lossless compression and
                           the loss is generally very small.  And, in fact,
                           every operation of converting an image is lossy
                           (the original photographic or electronic process
                           which captured the image was lossy, scanning or
                           digitizing the image was lossy, displaying the
                           image on a monitor is lossy, and printing the
                           image is lossy).


          Details          JPEG compression involves the following steps:

                   Step 1  The image is converted to a colour space with
                           separate luminance and chrominance channels.
                           This is done because the human eye is far more
                           sensitive to the luminance information (Y) than
                           it is to the chrominance information (Cb and
                           Cr); by separating them, it's possible to
                           compress the chrominance information more than
                           the luminance before the perceived image quality
                           suffers.

                           This step isn't specified in the JPEG draft (it
                           doesn't discuss colour space at all), but is
                           standard practice.  Image Alchemy uses CCIR-601
                           YCbCr, which is the colour space specified by
                           the JFIF standard.

                   Step 2  The luminance and chrominance information are
                           separately transformed to the frequency domain
                           using a discrete cosine transform acting on 8x8
                           pixel blocks.

                           To reduce the amount of data which needs to be
                           compressed the chrominance information may be
                           sub-sampled first.  Alchemy uses
                           2h:1v:1h:1v:1h:1v sub-sampling when writing JPEG
                           files, which means that the first component
                           (luminance) has twice as many samples
                           horizontally as the other two components
                           (chrominance), and the same number of samples
                           vertically.  Alchemy can read JPEG files with
                           any sub-sampling allowed by the draft standard.

                   Step 3  The transformed data is quantized (so some
                           information is thrown away).  The samples
                           representing higher frequencies are generally
                           quantized using larger steps than those
                           representing low frequencies.

                           The quality level you specify is used to scale a
                           set of quantization values which have been found
                           to cause the quantized data to all have
                           approximately equal importance visually.  A
                           lower quality number will cause larger
                           quantization steps to be used, and hence
                           increase the compression ratio and decrease the
                           image quality.

                   Step 4  The quantized data is compressed using an
                           entropy coder.  Huffman and Arithmetic coding
                           are allowed by the draft JPEG standard; only
                           Huffman coding is allowed by the JFIF standard.
                           Huffman coding can either be done with a set of
                           fixed tables or custom tables can be generated
                           for an image.  Alchemy, by default, uses a fixed
                           set of tables, but can also generate custom
                           tables which usually produce 5-20% (depending on
                           the image and quality setting) better
                           compression.  However, producing custom tables
                           requires an additional pass over the image data
                           and therefore takes a little longer.


          JPEG Interchange This data corresponds to the JPEG Interchange
          Format           Format and is ready to be stored in a file.
                           Unfortunately the JPEG Interchange Format does
                           not include enough information to actually be
                           able to convert the file back to an image.
                           Specifically the colour space used and the
                           aspect ratio or resolution of the image are not
                           included.  Until recently there was no standard
                           way of putting this information in a JPEG file.

          JFIF             On March 1, 1991 representatives of several JPEG
                           hardware and software developers (including C-
                           Cube, Radius, NeXT, Storm Tech., the PD JPEG
                           group, Sun, and Handmade Software) met at C-Cube
                           and established the JPEG File Interchange Format
                           (JFIF).  If you would like more information on
                           the JFIF standard please contact us.

                           does not read correctly.

          What we need to  If you come across any files which Image Alchemy
          fix the problem  has trouble with please contact us with as much
                           of the following information as you have:
                           version of Image Alchemy you are using, type of
                           file, type of computer which generated it, name
                           and version of software which wrote the file,
                           size of image, and the number of colours in
                           image.  We may ask you to send us the file so
                           that we can figure out what went wrong.  If you
                           send us a file we will attempt to modify Image
                           Alchemy so that it can read the file.  And if by
                           some miracle we manage to get it to work, we
                           will send you an updated copy of Image Alchemy.

                           Similarly, if any files that Image Alchemy
                           writes can not be read by other software we want
                           to know that also.  Since we do not own a copy
                           of every software package we may ask you to send
                           us a copy of a file that can be read by that
                           package; we will then compare that to a file
                           written out by Image Alchemy to determine what
                           the differences are.


                           Please contact us even if you are just using a
                           demo copy of Alchemy.  In addition to helping
                           fix a potential bug, we feel the best way to get
                           you to purchase a copy of Alchemy is to
                           demonstrate how committed we are to customer
                           support.

          Binary Information Files (BIF)
          -----------------------------------------------------------------          -----------------------------------------------------------------


          Overview         Binary files are image files which are just
                           data.  In other words, they do not contain any
                           information other than the actual pixels in the
                           image.  In order to read these files you must
                           create a file using a text editor which
                           describes to Alchemy the format of the file you
                           are trying to read in.  This is called a BIF
                           file (and normally has the extension .bif).

          Required         At the minimum a BIF file needs to contain the
          information      filename of the image file and either the height
                           or the width of the image.  Alchemy will make
                           assumptions about the other characteristics of
                           the image based on the information that it is
                           given and the total length of the image file.


          BIF file format  The first line contains the letters BIF, which
                           identifies the file as a BIF file.

                           Each of the rest of the lines in the BIF file
                           consist of an information tag followed by the
                           information.  The spelling of the tags must be
                           exact or Alchemy will report an unknown tag
                           error.

          Tags

                      Tag  Description

                 filename  The name of the file containing the binary data.

                    width  The width of the image data, in pixels.

                   height  The height of the image data, in pixels.

                   planes  The number of planes of image data (1, 2, 3, or
                           4).
                           A 1 plane image is assumed to be gray-scale, a 2
                           plane image is a gray-scale image with an alpha
                           channel, a 3 plane image is a RGB image, and a 4
                           plane image is a RGB image with an alpha
                           channel.

                   header  The size of the header, in bytes.  This many
                           bytes will be skipped when reading the file.

              leftpadding  The number of bytes to remove from the beginning
                           of each scan line.

             rightpadding  The number of bytes to remove from the end of
                           each scan line.

                    order  The order of the pixels.
                           For 3 channel images, this can be any sequence
                           of r, g, and b: rgb, rbg, grb, gbr, brg, or bgr
                           (r=red, g=green, b=blue).
                           For 4 channel images, this can be any sequence
                           of a, r, g, and b (a=alpha).
                           Either ga or ag for 2 channel images (g=gray,
                           a=alpha).

                           The defaults are g, ga, rgb, and rgba, depending
                           on the number of planes.

               upsidedown  The presence of this tag indicates that the data
                           in the file is recorded from the bottom of the
                           screen up to the top of the screen.



          Comments         Lines beginning with a # are treated as
                           comments.  Comments and blank lines are ignored
                           when processing the file.

          Palette files    If the binary file has a palette available, you
                           can use that palette by writing custom software
                           to convert it to a .PAL file and using the -F
                           option while reading the BIF file.

          Example          This is an example BIF file which can be used to
                           read a 640 pixel wide, true colour HSI Raw file.
                           Note that HSI raw files have a 32 byte header
                           which is being skipped.  Of course you could
                           read the Raw file directly using Alchemy, but
                           this is after all an example of a BIF file.

                                width    640
                                #skip past header
                                header    32

                                filename  sample.raw
                                planes     3

                                #the tag below isn't actually needed,
                                #since rgb is the default, but is
                                #included here to give an example of
                                #what an order tag looks like

                                order   rgb

          Using the        Assuming the BIF file is called sample.bif, the
          example BIF file following Alchemy command can be used to convert
                           the image to a GIF file:

                                alchemy sample.bif -g

                           The height of the image will be automatically
                           calculated from the length of the file and the
                           width, header, and planes tags.

                           A BIF file is treated as an ordinary file, so
                           all the standard Alchemy commands may be used.

          HSI Raw Files
          -----------------------------------------------------------------          -----------------------------------------------------------------


          History          The HSI Raw format was originally intended as an
                           internal format to Image Alchemy.  Because of
                           user demand the format has been documented to
                           allow others to read and write HSI Raw files.

          Overview         HSI Raw files are completely uncompressed,
                           unpacked, and unpadded image data files.
                           Therefore they tend to be larger than almost any
                           compressed file format.  However, they have the
                           advantage, as far as Alchemy is concerned, that
                           they are very fast to read and write and the
                           location of any pixel in the image may be found
                           by simple calculations.

                           If you need to convert custom files to a format
                           that Alchemy can read we recommend using a Raw
                           file; it is the simplest format to write and the
                           fastest for Alchemy to read.

          Variations       There are two types of HSI Raw Files:  paletted
                           and true colour.  Paletted images are stored one
                           byte per pixel with a palette at the beginning
                           of the file.  True colour files are stored three
                           bytes per pixel.

               Gray-scale  Gray scale files are stored as paletted files
                           with a palette that contains all gray values.
                           Alchemy automatically recognizes such files
                           during reading and will treat them
                           appropriately.

          Black and white  Black and White files are stored as paletted
                           files with a palette that contains two values,
                           black and white.  Alchemy automatically
                           recognizes such files during reading and will
                           treat them appropriately.

          Warning          Note that Handmade Software, Inc. reserves the
                           right to make changes to this format at any time
                           and without notice.  And while it is unlikely,
                           it is possible that future versions of Image
                           Alchemy will not support this format.

          Old version      This appendix describes version 4 Raw files.
          files            This is the version that Image Alchemy has
                           written since March 1991.  Before this Alchemy
                           wrote version 2 and 3 raw files (version 2 were
                           8 bit files, version 3 were 24 bit files).
                           Those raw files can be read by current versions
                           of Image Alchemy but are not otherwise
                           supported.  If you run across any of these raw
                           files the easiest thing to do is to use a
                           current copy of Alchemy to convert them to a
                           version 4 raw file.



          Details

                Word size  All values which are not otherwise identified
                           are two byte integers (16 bits).  This is the
                           native integer size of most IBM PC C-compilers
                           but not for Macintosh and Sun C-compilers.

               Byte order  All integers are stored high byte first (big-
                           endian order).  This is the native mode for
                           Macintosh's and Sun's but not the native mode
                           for IBM PC's.

                           See below for a CPU independent method to read
                           and write 2-byte integers.

             Pixel format  Paletted files are stored one byte per pixel.

                           True colour files are stored as three bytes per
                           pixel in red, green, blue order.

                  Padding  Neither the palette information nor the pixel
                           data is padded to anything other than a byte

                           which is 13 by 11 pixels it will occupy 429
                           bytes if stored as a true colour file (not
                           including the header), or 143 bytes if stored as
                           a paletted file (not including the header and
                           palette data).

                      Hex  Numbers including a 0x prefix are hex; all other
                           numbers are decimal.



          File format      The header for a paletted file is 32 bytes plus
                           the size of the palette.  The header for a true
                           colour file is exactly 32 bytes (a true colour
                           file contains no palette).

                    Width  An integer indicating the width of the image (in
                           pixels).

                   Height  An integer indicating the height of the image
                           (in pixels).

             Palette size  An integer indicating the number of entries in
                           the palette.  Range is 2 to 256.  A 0 indicates
                           a true colour image (which has no palette data).

           Horizontal DPI  An integer indicating the horizontal resolution
                           of the image, in dots per inch.  A zero
                           indicates that the resolution is unknown.  A
                           negative number is used if only the aspect ratio
                           is known.

             Vertical DPI  An integer indicating the vertical resolution of
                           the image, in dots per inch.  A zero indicates
                           that the resolution is unknown.  A negative
                           number is used if only the aspect ratio is
                           known.

                    Gamma  An integer indicating the gamma of the image,
                           scaled by 100 (a gamma of 2.2 is stored as 220).
                           A zero indicates that the gamma is not known.

                 Reserved  Twelve bytes reserved for future use.  Should be
                           set to zero when writing.

          Undercolour Removal Files
          -----------------------------------------------------------------          -----------------------------------------------------------------


          Summary          Undercolour removal files are text files which
                           control the conversion from RGB to CMYK colour
                           space.

                           This conversion consists of four steps.  The
                           first is to convert an RGB value to an ideal CMY
                           value; this simply involves negating the RGB
                           values.  The next step is to determine how much
                           black is in that colour; this is done by finding
                           the minimum of the CMY values and using that as
                           an index into the black removal tables
                           documented below.  These tables have independent
                           values for how much black to use for that pixel
                           and how much black to subtract from the CMY
                           values.  Next, a linear transform is optionally
                           applied to the CMY portion of the CMYK pixel.
                           Finally the CMYK values are optionally
                           translated, independently, through the CMYK
                           density correction tables (this last step is
                           only used if Alchemy is going to dither the
                           image for output on a 1 bit per pixel per
                           component device).

          File format      Any line beginning with ';' is a comment and is
                           ignored.

            Black removal  The first 256 non-comment lines contain
                   tables  undercolour removal values corresponding to
                           computed black values of 0 (white) to 255
                           (black).  Each of these lines has two numbers;
                           the first indicates how much black to use in
                           place of the computed black value corresponding
                           to the line, and the second indicates how much
                           black to subtract from the cyan, magenta, and
                           yellow components (this value must not be
                           greater than the corresponding computed black
                           value).

                           After the black removal block the remaining
                           blocks may appear in any order:

               CMY linear  If there is a line which says only "HSI CMY
                transform  matrix" then the next 3 non-comment lines
                           contain a matrix representing a linear transform
                           which is applied to the cyan, magenta, and
                           yellow components after black removal and before
                           applying the density map.  The entries are
                           normalized around 256.  The first row and column
                           represent cyan, the second magenta, and the
                           third yellow.  The rows are multiplied by the
                           input cyan, magenta, and yellow values to create
                           the corrected values.  A matrix of

                                256   0   0
                                  0 256   0
                                  0   0 256

                           is equivalent to omitting the matrix and causes
                           no correction to take place.  In this case it
                           would be preferable to omit the matrix as the
                           conversion will run slightly faster without it.

             CMYK density  If there is a line which says only "HSI CMYK
               correction  density map" then the next 256 non-comment lines
                   tables  contain density correction tables, corresponding
                           to cyan, magenta, yellow, and black values of 0
                           (white) to 255.  Each of these lines has four
                           numbers representing, in order, the amount of
                           cyan, magenta, yellow, and black to use in place
                           of the corresponding computed values.  These
                           tables are only applied during dithering; they
                           will not be used for those CMYK output formats
                           which are continuous tone, as devices which take
                           continuous tone input data should be doing their
                           own correction.

          PAL Files
          -----------------------------------------------------------------          -----------------------------------------------------------------


          Overview         PAL files are text files which contain a palette
                           in an ASCII form.  Alchemy can extract palettes
                           from other file formats and write PAL files.
                           Alchemy can also use PAL files when converting
                           images.

          File format      The first line contains the letters "PAL"; this
                           identifies the file as a palette file.

                           The next line contains an integer indicating the
                           number of palette entries.  Valid values are 2
                           through 256.

                           The rest of the file consists of lines of 3
                           numbers each (separated by spaces) representing

          Summary          Almost all the software which comprises Image
                           Alchemy was written in house.  However the TIFF
                           and 640x400 SVGA display modules are
                           modifications of software originally written by
                           other people.

                           Both of these modules are free for anyone's use
                           as long as proper credit is given as to the
                           origin of the software.


                     TIFF  Image Alchemy's TIFF I/O is based on libtiff
                           which is copyright by Sam Leffler and is used
                           with his permission.  If you are interested in
                           reading or writing TIFF files we strongly
                           suggest that you start with libtiff.

                           Libtiff is available by anonymous ftp as
                           ucbvax.berkeley.edu:pub/tiff/*.tar.Z or
                           uunet.uu.net:graphics/tiff.tar.Z.

                           If you can not get a copy of libtiff via

              VGA display  Image Alchemy's 640x400 SVGA display routines
                           are based on VGAKIT, written by John Bridges.

                           VGAKIT is available free of charge from a
                           variety of bulletin boards

          Glossary
          -----------------------------------------------------------------          -----------------------------------------------------------------


            Anonymous FTP  An easy way to transfer files via the Internet.
                           If you don't have Internet access you can't use
                           anonymous FTP; if you do have Internet access
                           you probably already know about it (if you
                           don't, ask your system administrator or local
                           network guru).

          Black and white  An image which contains just two colours, black
                           and white.  Many file formats, such as TIFF and
                           Sun Raster, have special variations for black
                           and white images.  You can force Alchemy to
                           write a black and white image by specifying
                           -b -c2 as options.

                Dithering  A technique for reducing the amount of colour
                           banding in an image when converting from a large
                           number of different colours to a small number of
                           different colours.  Different dithering
                           techniques are usually named after the person or
                           persons who first invented them.  Alchemy
                           supports Floyd-Steinberg, Stucki, and JJN
                           dithering; these are further described in
                           "Digital Halftoning", by Robert Ulichnet, MIT
                           Press.

               Gray-scale  An image which contains just shades of gray.
                           Many file formats, such as TIFF and Silicon
                           Graphics, have special variations for gray-scale
                           images.  You can force Alchemy to write a gray-
                           scale image by specifying -b -8 as options.

                   Header  The portion of an image file that is not the
                           actual image data.  The data in a header
                           generally includes the image size (in pixels),
                           the image depth (in number of bits per pixel or
                           number of colours), and the palette (if the
                           image has a palette).  Some file formats include
                           quite a bit of additional data in the header,
                           such as:  the name of the image, the date and
                           time the image was created, and the latitude and
                           longitude of the image (primarily used by
                           satellite image data).  The header is called the
                           header because it usually appears at the head of
                           the file.  Some file formats store information
                           which is usually found in the header in a
                           separate file.

          Heckbert colour  A technique for reducing the number of colours
             quantization  needed by an image, typically used to convert a
                           true colour image to a paletted image.  Named
                           after Paul Heckbert who originally described the
                           technique in "Color Image Quantization for Frame
                           Buffer Display", SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings, p.
                           297.

             Magic Number  A number or sequence of numbers that is found at
                           or near the start of an image file so that
                           software may determine what type of format the
                           file is.  Most formats have a well defined magic
                           number; some formats do not, in which case
                           Alchemy examines various parameters in the
                           header of the file and guesses what format the
                           image is.

                 Paletted  An image which isn't true colour.  Each pixel in
                           the image is an index into a table of values
                           (typically red, green, and blue) which describe
                           the colour of that pixel.  Most paletted images
                           are limited to 8 bits of information, which
                           allows 256 unique colours.  Most display
                           adapters only allow the display of paletted
                           images (Alchemy can display true colour images
                           on those display adapters by using a uniform
                           palette).

              True colour  An image which does not contain a palette.  Each
                           pixel in the image is represented by at least
                           three values, typically red, green, and blue.
                           True colour images are generally produced by
                           scanners and digitizers and are better quality
                           and much larger than paletted images.  Most
                           display systems can not display true colour
                           images.
