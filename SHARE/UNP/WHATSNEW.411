
Message from author:
  Due to the rapidly increasing number of encrypters/compressers and
  related programs I have decided to try to write a generic extractor.
  I am not sure if UNP will be discontinued right now, but it will not
  be updated before the release of this program. 
  People which have already mailed programs to me, thanks very much but
  I do not have the time at the moment to write back. I am very sorry for
  that.

       Thanks for reading,
           Ben Castricum



New in V4.11 compared to V4.10 of UNP:
- Added extra INFO line for .EXE headers 
- Added UCEXE V2.3
- Changed PKTINY text in UNP.DOC, replaced "DIET" with "TINYPROG" :)
- Fixed bug causing UNP to only convert first file with X command.
- Fixed filename bug.
- Minor cosmetic bug fixed appearing when analyzing 0 bytes files.
- Changed memory error reporting.
- Fixed bug in extracting WWPACK and added WWPACK V3.02(a).
- Changed MKS routine into a 2 step process (like WWPACK), also fixed
  "unknown GI" bug.
- Changed CPAV/TAV routine to recognize another version.
- Added more text about compressors in .DOC file.
- Added code to let UNP automicly retry (-a) when unpacking a 2 step
  process (MKS, WWPACK and OPTLINK).
- Added identify entry for PACKWIN V1.0à
- Fixed bug causing UNP to create invalid files (negative overlays).

This version has been assigned 4.10 due to a hacked version of UNP which
claims to be V4.00 of UNP.

V4.10 is a major rewrite, UNP now takes advantage of the single-step
interrupt (I was trying to avoid this actually but can be pretty
handy!). Other changes over V3.31 are:

- Added T command which traces the executable until it can unpack it (in
   case of .EXE files) or until it's unpacked (.COM files).
- Also added O command which copies overlays.
- Added M command to insert a file into an exe-header.
- Added D command to make it possible to set the default options.
- Added -f switch, this performs the same as HDROPT supplied with
   PKLITE.
- Added -l switch to force UNP to give the program more memory than it
   actually wants.
- Added -m switch to force UNP to take a pause at every screen full of
   information.
- Added or improved a lot of routines to unpack to programs including
   PROTECT! EXE/COM V4.0 and V5.0 for which I received a lot of requests.
- IMPORTANT!: I have a new Email address! See UNP.DOC!



Changes made from V3.30 to V3.31

- Added a doc for UNP. I didn't realise how important it is to have some
   documentation. This doc is quick update of the V3.15 doc. Please don't
   sue me if there is anything I forget to update..  I have removed the
   sections which were really outdated though.


Due to a bogus V3.20a version of UNP floating around on BBSs, this version
will be called V3.30.

I have basicly given up support for the UNP V3.x serie since I am writing
a complete new version of UNP. So there is no need to send bugreports of
this version. This release is just a result of a lot of requests for
the tinyprog/pktiny stuff.

If you are getting divide errors, try using "unp -l .." or "loadfix unp..".

Changes made from V3.15 to V3.30

- added SCRNCH V1.02
- added TINPROG V3.0, V3.8 and V3.9
- added handling of pktiny-ed files with PKTINY V1.0 and V1.4
- fixed bug causing dieted files on systems with much memory free to
   generate a divide error.
- added (another) safety check on PkHeaders, this header could still cause
   system crashes :(
(BTW. I have recieved copies of propack and ice, thanks!)


Due to some minor errors in releasing V3.13 and V3.14 this version of UNP 
is released as V3.15.  The changes made from UNP V3.15 to V3.12:

- fixed bug which in certain cases messed up 2 bytes in the resulting file
- added PROTECT! EXE/COM V3.1


Changes made from UNP V3.12 to V3.11

Due to a hard disk crash I lost propack v2.08 and ice V1.00, can anyone
who has one or both of these pleeeaaassseeee send it to me?

Also, I decided to release UNP as freewhere (see doc), please register!

- improved check for write errors
- added code to avoid infinite loop when using -a option and Infile and
  and Outfile are specified
- added PROTECT! EXE/COM V3.0
- fixed bug which sometimes discarded the last byte of an exepacked file
- added -l switch to disable the feature below
- changed loadfix routine, files are now reloaded when they are loaded too
  low and they require one segment below (with this larger files can be
  handled)
- added code to remove a routine that converts exe to com files found on
  FORMAT.COM supplied with dos6
- added routine to unpack a program called UsR-Patch v3.0
- fixed minor bug in identifying DIET routines
- added DIET V1.45f and DIET 1.44 with -G option
- Changed command line processing :
   - UNP's Infile wildcard is now by default set to *.* if you have
     specified a command.
   - a *.* is automaticly added now if Infile ends with a '\'


Changes made from UNP V3.11 to V3.10

- rewrote tinyprog routine, now also able to unpack some unknown version
- added PROTECT! EXE/COM V1.0, V1.1 and V2.0 (encrypts and checks CRCs
  on COM and EXE files)

- added PKLITE V1.00á (2), see doc

- added writing back with COM structure of dieted COM files


Changes made from UNP V3.02 to V3.01

- added s command to show a list of compressed files
- added -k switch for pklite signature handling in batch files. Note
  that the signature is added by default now!
- program crashed when decompressing compack with EMM386 as memory
  manager, fixed.

- fixed options -c -a to not retry when a 'N' is answered
- added removing of Central Point Anti-Virus immunize code
- added a removable 'fake PKLITE signature'

- changed -a option to not retry when decompression failed
- identified PKLITE V1.10 (3) and V1.14 (1)
- added handling of a scramble routine found in a program sent to me
- finally added decompressing PGMPAK V0.14 (stupid bug on my side :(
- rewrote EXEPACK routine and fixed a bug in this


Changes made from UNP V3.00 to V3.01

Although UNP V3.00 is a complete rewrite, I'll try to mention the most
important changes compared with V2.13..
