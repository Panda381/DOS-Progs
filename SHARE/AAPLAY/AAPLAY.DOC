         THE AUTODESK ANIMATOR PLAYER PROGRAM

         The Autodesk Animator Player program (aaplay.exe)  is  a  flic
         "projector" program that lets  you  play  your  animations  or
         display your pictures. You can freely distribute this program,
         along with the aaplay.doc file, and your animations to friends
         and  business  associates.  The   aaplay.doc   file   contains
         instructions for using the Autodesk Animator Player program.

         The Autodesk Animator Player can be used either interactively,
         with mouse or keyboard, or through scripted control.  Scripted
         control uses an ASCII text file to instruct Autodesk  Animator
         Player to display a sequence of animations or pictures in  any
         order, with  assigned  individual  speeds  and  other  special
         effects.


         INTERACTIVE CONTROL

         The Autodesk Animator Player program is in  the  directory  in
         which you installed Autodesk Animator.

         To run Autodesk Animator Player in interactive mode:

         1.   Go to the directory containing Autodesk Animator Player.

         2.   Enter the following at the DOS prompt:

              aaplay

              A black screen appears with a menu bar at the top and
              control sliders at the bottom.

         You    can    use    Autodesk     Animator     Player     with
         a Microsoft-compatible mouse or by keyboard. (Be sure to  copy
         the appropriate  mouse  driver  to  the  directory  containing
         Autodesk Animator.) This appendix describes mouse input  first
         then keyboard input. If you do not have a mouse  device,  skip
         ahead to the section on keyboard input.



         MOUSE INPUT

         This section describes how to use a mouse to load a flic, play
         a flic, view individual frames, and change a flic's speed.


         Loading a Flic

         Use the following steps to load a flic using a mouse:

         1.   Select Fli Load from the File menu.

              The file selector appears. If desired, you can  exit  the
              file  selector  (and   take   no   further   action)   by
              right-clicking on the viewing screen.

         2.   If the flic you want is listed in the file window at  the
              left, double-click on the flic's name to select and  load
              the flic. Another method is to click  once  on  the  flic
              name (which will appear in the File field), then click on
              OK.

              The flic files (extension .fli) are listed in the  window
              at the left of the file selector. If there are more flics
              than will fit in the window display, scroll  through  the
              window by clicking on the  up  and  down  arrows  in  the
              slider bar to the left of the window or by  dragging  the
              slider bar up and down. (To drag, point the mouse at  the
              slider, hold down the left mouse  button,  and  move  the
              mouse. Release the button to release the slider.)

              If the flic is located in  another  drive  or  directory,
              click on the following icons:

               A: D:   to go to another drive. Each drive you have is
                       represented by a drive button.

               \       to go to the root directory of the current drive.

               ..      to go up a directory.

              You can enter any directory listed in the file window  by
              clicking  on  that  directory's  name.  (Directories  are
              listed in the window preceded by a slash  (\)  mark,  for
              example, \FLICS.)

              Note: Autodesk Animator flics are designed to  be  played
              from a hard disk or a RAM disk. If they are  played  from
              a floppy disk drive, the animation  speed  will  be  very
              slow.

              After you have loaded a  flic,  it  will  appear  on  the
              screen with menu displays that let  you  view  individual
              frames, play the flic,  change  the  flic's  speed,  load
              another flic, and exit Autodesk Animator Player. You  can
              toggle the menu displays by right-clicking on the viewing
              screen.


         Playing a Flic

         The slider bar at the bottom of the  screen  is  the  playback
         bar, which lets you view individual frames or play the  entire
         flic.

         To play the entire flic, do this:

         1.   Click on the double-arrows:

              The menus disappear and the flic plays through.

         2.   To stop the flic, right-click on the viewing screen.

              The flic stops and the menus reappear.


         Viewing Individual Frames

         The slider bar at the bottom left of the screen also lets  you
         view individual frames of a flic.  Click  on  these  icons  to
         perform the following actions:

              up arrow       moves to first frame.
              left arrow     moves back one frame.
              right arrow    moves forward one frame.
              down arrow     moves to last frame.
              slider bar     drags to desired frame.

         Click within the numbered bar to jump to another frame in  the
         animation. For example, clicking on  the  right  side  of  the
         numbered bar takes you to a frame near the end of the flic.


         Changing a Flic's Speed

         The slider bar at the bottom right of the screen controls  the
         flic's  playback  speed.  The  numbered  bar  represents   the
         duration of pause for each frame. A lower speed setting  plays
         the flic faster, a higher speed setting slows the  flic  down.
         To change a flic's speed, click on the left or right arrows to
         adjust the speed by single  increments  or  drag  the  bar  to
         a desired speed.

         The speed you set is temporary. After you exit the  flic,  the
         original speed settings return.

         The following section describes keyboard input.  If  you  have
         a mouse device, see "Further Keyboard Input," later on in this
         appendix,  for  keyboard  controls   available   during   flic
         playback.



         KEYBOARD INPUT

         This section describes how to use the keyboard to load a flic,
         play a flic, view  individual  frames,  and  change  a  flic's
         speed. You can use the keyboard for these  functions  even  if
         you have a mouse.


         Selecting Menu Items

         Select any item in the menu bar by first pressing the  key  on
         your keyboard corresponding to the first letter  of  the  menu
         title, and then pressing the key corresponding  to  the  first
         letter of the menu item. For example, to select GIF Load  from
         the File menu, press the F key  (to  select  File),  then  the
         G key (to select GIF Load).


         How Keyboard Entry Works in the File Selector

         There are two modes of keyboard entry when the  file  selector
         is on screen: keyboard  entry  mode,  and  keyboard  alternate
         mode.

         Keyboard entry mode lets you enter text. When  the  cursor  in
         any one keyboard entry box  (such  as  the  File  or  Dir)  is
         a solid box, you are in keyboard  entry  mode,  and  keys  you
         press will enter text in the keyboard entry box in  which  the
         cursor appears.

         Keyboard alternate mode lets  you  enter  commands.  When  the
         cursor in all keyboard entry boxes is a  thin  vertical  line,
         you are in keyboard alternate mode, and keys you press perform
         selections on the  file  selector-in  much  the  same  way  as
         pointing with a mouse.

         When the file selector is displayed, press the following  keys
         as needed:

              KEY:                FUNCTION:

              TAB                 Toggles the keyboard entry  mode  (as
                                  well as the cursor  display)  and  to
                                  move from field to field

              ESC                 Clears a field

              left arrow key      Moves the cursor left

              right arrow key     Moves the cursor right

              up arrow key        Scrolls up the list of files  in  the
                                  file selection window

              down arrow key      Scrolls down the list of files in the
                                  file selection window

              BACKSPACE           Deletes characters left of the cursor

              A B C etc.          Selects  another  disk  drive.   Each
                                  drive you have is represented  by  an
                                  alphabetical key.

              \                   Moves to the root directory of the
                                  current drive

              . (period)          Moves up a directory

              ENTER               Selects OK


         Loading a Flic

         To load a flic using the keyboard:

         1.   Press the F key (to select  File),  and  then  press  the
              F key  again  (to  select  Fli  Load).The  file  selector
              appears. If desired, you can exit the file selector  (and
              take no further action) by pressing Tab followed  by  the
              spacebar.

         2.   Press TAB until the block cursor is active  in  the  File
              keyboard entry box.

         3.   Press ESC to clear the field, then type in  the  name  of
              your flic. (You don't have to type in the .fli extension,
              which is assumed.)

         4.   Press ENTER to load the flic.

              The first frame of the flic appears on screen to indicate
              that it is ready to be played.

         If the flic is located in another drive, do this:

         1.   Press TAB until the cursor is in the Dir field.

         2.   Press ESC to clear the field.

         3.   Enter the flic's pathname (e.g., c:\directory\filename).

         After you have loaded a flic, it will  appear  on  the  screen
         with menu displays that let you view individual  frames,  play
         the flic, change the flic's speed, load another flic, and exit
         Autodesk Animator Player. You can toggle the menu displays  by
         pressing the spacebar.


         Playing a Flic

         The slider bar at the bottom of the  screen  is  the  playback
         bar, which lets you view individual frames or play the  entire
         flic.

         To play the entire flic:

         1.   Press ENTER.

              The menus disappear and the flic plays through.

         2.   To stop the flic, press the spacebar.

              The flic stops and the menus reappear.


         Viewing Individual Frames

         The slider bar at the bottom left of the screen also lets  you
         view individual frames of a flic. Press the following keys  as
         needed:

              KEY:                FUNCTION:

              up arrow key        Moves to first frame

              left arrow key      Moves back one frame

              right arrow key     Moves forward one frame

              ENTER               Plays flic

              down arrow key      Moves to last frame


         Changing a Flic's Speed

         The slider bar at the bottom right of the screen controls  the
         flic's  playback  speed.  The  numbered  bar  represents   the
         duration of pause between frames. For example, a high  setting
         will slow the flic down, not speed it up. Press the - (hyphen)
         key to increase the speed by single increments;  press  the  +
         key to decrease the speed by single increments.

         The speed you set is temporary. After you exit the  flic,  the
         original settings return.

         To enter a specific speed (e.g., a setting of 4), see "Further
         Keyboard Input," below.


         FURTHER KEYBOARD INPUT

         The following keys, which  can  be  used  by  both  mouse  and
         keyboard users, affect the flic during playback.

              KEY:                FUNCTION:

              BACKSPACE           Freezes current frame (press any key 
                                  to continue playback
              +                   Increases speed setting by single
                                  increments. The flic is slowed down.
              -                   Decreases speed setting by single
                                  increments. The flic is sped up.
              F1                  Speed 0
              F2                  Speed 3
              F3                  Speed 6
              F4                  Speed 9
              F5                  Speed 12
              F6                  Speed 18
              F7                  Speed 24
              F8                  Speed 36
              F9                  Speed 48
              F10                 Returns to original speed (speed 
                                  loaded with flic)
              ESC                 Breaks loop (only during script
                                  playback)


         Locking the Keyboard During a Playback

         A "keyboard lock"  is  a  command  you  enter  to  render  the
         keyboard inactive until the next time you enter  the  keyboard
         command. You can use a keyboard lock any time an animation  or
         a script of animations is running.  It  is  designed  to  keep
         curious fingers from halting your demonstrations.

         To lock the keyboard, do this:

         1.   Hold down the CTRL key and press any alphabetical key (A
              through Z).

              Note: For an 80286 machine, hold down the  CTRL  key  and
              press the M key.

              Be sure to remember which key you pressed! If you forget,
              the only way  to  exit  is  to  reset  your  computer  by
              pressing CTRL- ALT-DEL simultaneously. (Or you could  try
              every letter in the alphabet while holding down the  CTRL
              key.)

         2.   To unlock the keyboard, hold down CTRL and press the same
              key.



         SCRIPT FILE CONTROL

         A script file is simply a text script  containing  a  list  of
         flics and/or GIF pictures to display in succession. GIF  files
         are  single  pictures,  which  you  can   load   and   display
         individually by selecting GIF Load from  the  Files  menu.  In
         script mode, you can display a GIF file and leave  it  on  the
         screen for a specified number of seconds.

         Note: Autodesk Animator GIF files are 320X200 resolution only.
         Use the Converter utility to translate other  resolution  .gif
         files prior to using Autodesk Animator Player.

         You can write a script file  with  any  text  editor  or  word
         processor that produces a standard ASCII (or DOS  text)  file.
         Script files can be created in Autodesk  Animator  itself,  if
         desired. To do so, use the Text tool to enter the script text.
         It is recommended that you create the text  using  the  System
         (default) font, since it creates the dash necessary to specify
         parameters (e.g., -S). After you exit Autodesk  Animator,  the
         script text is saved in  a  .txt  file  (e.g.,  myscript.txt),
         which then can  be  loaded  in  Autodesk  Animator  Player  as
         a script file.

         Caution: The native file format of most word processors is not
         ASCII and does not work as a script file. However,  most  word
         processors have the ability to save text in ASCII format.

         At its simplest level, a script file that  plays  three  flics
         and a picture in sequence looks like this:

              D:cartoon.fli
              C:\flic\astonish.fli
              C:\pics\portrait.gif
              D:bounce.fli

         Notice that you must specify the full filename  and  extension
         for each flick or GIF picture. However, you  need  to  specify
         the drive path only if the file is not in  the  same  path  as
         Autodesk Animator Player.

         Note: You can use any mixture of upper- or  lowercase  letters
         to create a script file.



         PLAYING A SCRIPT FILE

         You can give the script file any  filename  and/or  extension.
         Assuming the above script file  is  named  myscript,  you  can
         invoke it in one of two ways:

         o    From the DOS prompt, enter the following command:

                   aaplay myscript

         o    From within the Autodesk Animator Player,  select  Script
              Load from the Files menu, and then select  myscript  from
              the file selector.

         In the four-file script example described earlier,  the  first
         two listed animations each play through once, the GIF  picture
         is displayed for 5 seconds, and then the last animation  plays
         through once. At the  end  of  the  last  animation,  you  are
         returned to the DOS prompt if you start myscript from the  DOS
         prompt or to  the  Autodesk  Animator  Player  screen  if  you
         started myscript from the Autodesk Animator Player.

         Note: Because of the time taken to decompress GIF  files,  GIF
         pictures display relatively slowly, sweeping down  the  screen
         as they appear. We recommend that you make your  GIF  pictures
         frames in a flic then load the flic from the script file.  (If
         desired, use a  slow  playback  speed  for  a  slide-projector
         effect.)


         Additional Script Options

         In addition to its function specifying which flics or pics  to
         play,  the  script  file  can  include  these  parameters  and
         options:

         o    Special parameters describing how to play the flic  (such
              as its playback speed).

         o    Special options describing how may loops (or cycles) that
              each flic (or script file) plays  through,  and  choosing
              whether to return to DOS or the Autodesk Animator  Player
              at the end.


         Script Parameters

         Script parameters consist of a hyphen  followed  by  a  single
         code letter specifying the speed, the number of loops, and the
         type of transition between the flics.  The  parameter  letters
         and a control number  or  word  are  listed  behind  the  flic
         filename in the script file.

         Parameters you can set are listed in the table below:

         PARAMETER:         CONTROL EFFECT DEFAULT

              -L            0..999 Loops 0
              -S            0..120 Speed File speed
              -T            FADEIN..FADEOUT..CUT Transition Cut
              -P            0..14400 (14400=4 hours) Pause FLI=0, GIF-5

         You can list one, two, all three, or no parameters behind each
         listed filename in your script  file.  If  no  parameters  are
         listed after a filename, the default flic playback is a single
         loop at the speed specified by the file with no transition  (a
         clean cut).

         Loop, speed, or  pause  parameters  are  simply  a  matter  of
         listing the parameter letter followed by its control:

              fli1.fli -L3 -S6
              fli2.fli -S3
              fli3.fli -L2
              pic1.gif -P10
              fli4.fli -P20

         In the above  example,  fli1  plays  through  three  times  at
         a speed of 6; fli2 plays once at a speed of 3, and fli3  plays
         twice at the speed at which it was originally saved.  pic1.gif
         remains on screen for 10  seconds.  The  last  frame  of  fli4
         remains on screen 20 seconds.

         Note: Loop (-L) and speed (-S) have no effect on GIF files.

         Transitions are fades to or from  a  white  screen,  and  they
         require one or two control words following  the  parameter  to
         describe the type of transition at the beginning  and  end  of
         the flic playback. If one control word is omitted or  if  both
         are, a straight cut is assumed for the transition:

              fli1.fli -t fadein fadeout
              fli2.fli -t cut fadeout
              fli3.fli -t fadein cut
              fli4.fli -t fadeout
              fli5.fli -t fadein
              fli6.fli

         In the above example, fli1 fades in from a white  screen,  and
         fades out to a white screen; fli2 cuts in, and  fades  out  to
         a white screen; fli3 fades in from a  white  screen  and  ends
         with a cut; fli4 works like fli2; fli5 works  like  fli3;  and
         fli6 cuts in and out. As you can see, the control word cut may
         be left out in all cases.

         Here are some other examples:

              fli1.fli -L3 -S6 -t fadein fadeout
              fli2.fli -S3 -t fadein
              fli3.fli -L2 -t fadeout

         In the above example,  fli1  fades  in,  loops  through  three
         playbacks at speed 6, and fades out; fli2 then fades in, plays
         once at speed 3, and cuts; fli3 cuts in, loops  twice  at  its
         file speed, and then fades out.


         Script Options

         You can affect the playback of the entire script by using  the
         following option commands:

              OPTION:           EFFECT:

              LINK FILENAME     Loads and plays the specified script
                                file

              LOOP 0..999       Loops through the statements above this
                                statement (999 means loop infinitely)

              EXITTOPLAYER      Exits to the Autodesk Animator Player
                                after playing the script file

              EXITTODOS         Exits to DOS after playing the script
                                file

         Note: You can enter the above option words in any  combination
         of upper- or lowercase, but you can't include  spaces  between
         the letters (for example, ExitToPlayer is  fine  but  Exit  To
         Player isn't).

         These are examples of script options:

              fli1.fli
              fli2.fli -l2 -s5
              fli3.fli -t fadein
              loop 3

         Fli1 plays once; fli2 loops twice at a speed of 5; fli3  fades
         in from white and plays once; this entire combination  repeats
         three times before ending.

         Another example:

              fli1.fli
              fli2.fli
              loop 999
              fli3.fli

         Fli1 and fli2 alternately play through  once  in  an  infinite
         loop, which you can halt by pressing  ESC.  Fli3  never  plays
         since it follows the loop command.

         Here is yet another example:

              fli3.fli
              fli2.fli
              fli3.fli
              loop 2
              link d:\flic\script1

         Fli3 followed by fli2 followed by fli3  loops  through  twice,
         followed by the combination of flics described by the  script1
         script file plays.


         Scriptfile Formatting

         The Autodesk Animator Player lets you arrange the text in your
         script files in a very free  fashion.  As  mentioned  earlier,
         letters can be either upper- or lowercase.  In  addition,  you
         can list parameters after the flic filenames in any order, and
         you can use any number of white  spaces,  tabs,  and  carriage
         returns:

              fli1.fli -s 2 -l 3 -t fadein

         is exactly the same as the culmination of upper-/lower-case:

              FLI1.FLI -l3 -T FADEin -S2


         Keystrokes During Script Playback

         Unless the keyboard is locked, the keystrokes described in the
         "Further Keyboard Input" section earlier affect only the  flic
         currently playing. Thus if  a  keystroke  breaks  out  of  the
         current flic's loop, the next flic listed in the  Script  file
         immediately begins playback. If the speed is  altered  by  the
         keyboard during the cycle of one flic, the following  flic  in
         the script file reverts to its programmed speed.

         If a script loop (as opposed to a flic  loop)  is  in  effect,
         only the ESC key breaks out of that loop.

         When you have locked the keyboard by pressing CTRL and another
         key, all keyboard activity is inactive until you  repeat  that
         same CTRL key combination.


         Error Messages

         If you have made a typing  mistake  in  your  script  file  or
         included an instruction the Autodesk Animator Player does  not
         understand, a message similar to the following one appears:

              ERROR NEAR LINE 5 IN SCRIPT1.TXT
              ERROR IN PROCESSING SCRIPT FILE

              [4] FLI1.FLI -L3 -S5
              [5] FLI2.FLI S7
              [6] FLI3.FLI -L2

         The first two lines of the message might change, depending  on
         the error. The line most  probably  containing  the  error  is
         displayed between the preceding and subsequent  lines  of  the
         script file. Examine the lines closely for an error.  (In  the
         above example, the  hyphen  was  left  out  before  the  speed
         parameter in line 5.)

         Note: In some cases the error might  have  occurred  somewhere
         other than in the indicated line. If you can't find  an  error
         in the noted line, examine your entire script  file  carefully
         for a mistake. If you still can't find it, use  a  process  of
         elimination by first making a backup copy of the script  file,
         and then deleting certain lines until the script file works.
