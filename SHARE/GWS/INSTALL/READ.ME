Installing the shareware version

If you received Graphic Workshop as a ZIP file, do the following
to install it automatically:

1. Create a blank, formatted floppy disk capable of holding at 
least 720 kilobytes of data.
2. Unpack the contents of the Graphic Workshop ZIP file onto the
floppy disk.
3. Follow the instructions in the next section. Treat the floopy
disk you have unpacked Graphic Workshop onto as your Graphic 
Workshop master.

Note that the shareware version of Graphic Workshop does not 
include GWSCAP.ZIP or ACCESS.ZIP.

Unpacking these files
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

The quickest way to install Graphic Workshop on your hard drive is
to log into the floppy drive with your Graphic Workshop master
disk in it and type:

	SETUP ÄÙ

This will run an interactive setup function to unpack your files
and configure the software.

Note that this will install the GWSCAP screen capture program on
your hard drive as well. It will not install the accessory disk
contents. These are stored in ACCESS.ZIP on your Graphic Workshop
master disk, and must be unpacked manually, as discussed next, 
if you require them.

Manual unpacking
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
If you'd like to unpack Graphic Workshop by hand, do the following:

1. Create a subdirectory on your hard drive to put it in. 
2. Log into this subdirectory.
3. Type:

	A:ZIPPER A:GWSDOS ÄÙ

or

	B:ZIPPER B:GWSDOS ÄÙ

This will unpack Graphic Workshop.

Note that you can use PKUNZIP to unpack GWSDOS.ZIP as well.

You might also want to unpack GWSCAP.ZIP and ACCESS.ZIP, the Graphic
Workshop screen capture and accessory disk contents respectively.
