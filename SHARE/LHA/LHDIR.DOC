LHdir Version 1.3    5/89

Tested with all U.S. versions of LHarc through 1.13.

LHdir is a utility program to be used in conjunction with the LHarc file
compression program.  It has three purposes, depending on how its used.

1) As a directory utility.  Just like LHarc you can see the names and
sizes of files inside a LZH file.  Some example commands:
       LHDIR ABC.LZH
       LHDIR ABC
       LHDIR ABC *.TXT *.EXE

Unlike LHarc, you can also see what's inside a self-extracting COM or
EXE file created by LHarc.  This requires that the file you are looking
at be completely specified on the command line.
       LHDIR ABC.EXE
       LHDIR ABC.EXE *.TXT

2) As a converter of self-extracting to normal LZH files.  If the file
is self-extracting, you will be asked if you wish to convert it to a
normal LZH file after viewing the directory.  Answering 'Y' will create
a second file with the LZH extant and retain the original EXE or COM
file, should you wish to use it for other purposes.

3) As a scanner for self-extracting LHarc files you may have lost track
of.  If invoked as "LHDIR -S", the program will scan all EXE and COM
files in the current directory (limited to 300 COM and 300 EXE files)
and tell you which, if any, are really LHarc self-extracting files.

In the same spirit Yoshi has shown with LHarc, LHdir is free and may be
copied and distributed without fee, so long as the original copyright
notice remains intact and this doc file accompanies the program.

This program is distributed "as is" and no warranty of any kind is
expressed or implied.
