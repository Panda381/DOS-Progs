For the German documentation please read QV.DOK.

QuickView is Shareware. This means that you can test it for at most three
weeks. After that period you must register, i.e. pay a small registration
fee or discontinue using it. See REGISTER.DOC for details.


Features of QuickView:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Some call it QuickView others call it the possibly fastest viewer of the
world.
QuickView views the following file formats at present:

        OS/2 Icons (partly)

- .PCX: 1-4, 8 and 24 color bits

- .PIC: Videodat .PIC files

- .TGA: uncompressed: 8 and 24 color bits, 1-bit black & white
        RLE compressed: 8 and 24 color bits

- .VOC: through a Sound Blaster or the PC speaker

- .WAV: through a Sound Blaster or the PC speaker
        Supported audio codecs are:
        PCM, Microsoft ADPCM and Creative Labs ADPCM


System Requirements:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

QuickView will run on any IBM PC compatible computer under DOS 3.0 or
better with at least a 80286 processor. For viewing AVI files at least a
80386 processor is required. You must have a VGA card in your system. CGA,
EGA and Hercules cards are not supported.
For Sound Blaster support you must have the Environment variable BLASTER
set that contains port address, interrupt and DMA channel.

QuickView will run under Windows 3.1 and 95 in a DOS shell. PC Speaker
sound will not work in a DOS shell. You have to disable sound with AVIs
or run QuickView under plain DOS.

QuickView can view images larger than the available video hardware would
allow. This is accomplished by storing only those pixels in the main
memory that are outside the visible part of the image. This leads to
low memory requirements. Scrolling is not yet possible for pictures with
more than 8 color bits.


Installation:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Simply place all files of the package in a directory. That's it!
QuickView will automatically detect your machine, memory and graphics card.


Command Line Format:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

The command line format to run QuickView is:
QV [/M] [/V] [/Rx] [/S] [/Lx] [/I] [/A] [/2] [/4] [/Qx] [/Fx] [filename]

Options:
 /M  Select 50 lines menu mode. QuickView uses 25 line menu mode by
     default. For 50 lines you can use the /M option
 /V  Don't use VESA. QuickView autodetects many graphics cards and uses
     VESA by default. The /V option tells QuickView to not use the VESA
     interface if installed, but if you want to use HiColor or TrueColor
     modes the VESA interface must be used. If your graphics card does not
     support VESA you can use a VESA TSR like UNIVESA or UNIVBE (see
     below).
 /Rx Select screen resolution:
     x=1: 320*200
     x=2: 640*480
     x=3: 800*600
     x=4: 1024*768
     If a mode is not possible the nearest available will be used.
     default: auto select
 /S  Disable vertical hardware scrolling as this may cause problems on some
     graphics cards.
 /Lx Loop FLI/FLC x times, 0 => until key pressed, default: 0
 /I  Don't use Auto Init SB
 /A  No sound with AVIs
 /2  AVI Zoom 2x
 /4  Don't use 320*240, 256 colors mode with AVIs. QuickView will use
     320*240*256 mode by default if it allows to play the AVI full screen.
 /Qx AVI quality:
     x=0: TrueColor
     x=1: HiColor
     x=2: 256 colors
     x=3: Grey Scale
     Please note that these options are not available for all codecs. For
     details see the AVI options below. The default TrueColor will give
     best quality with all AVIs however it requires the most CPU power.
 /Fx Start AVI at frame x, e.g. /F137 (only in registered version)

All parameters are not case-sensitive.

filename can be a file that QuickView views or a name that contains the
wildcards * and ?.

Example: QV /A /Q2 VIDEO.AVI


The Menu:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

QuickView always shows you all the files in the current directory, along
with all the visible subdirectory names. The arrow keys will move the file
selector bar around. By pressing a character the file selector bar jumps to
the first file starting with that character. Use lower case for files,
upper case for directories. A mouse is not supported.
To view a file or change a directory just hit Enter. If you try to view
a file QuickView does not handle nothing will happen. If you have tagged
some files (256 at most) QuickView will view these files without going to
the menu in between. Hit Enter or Tab if you want to view the next file
and Backspace for the previous one. Esc breaks and returns to the menu.

More keys during file selection:

 ALT-D: Change drive. A drive selection box will appear, prompting you for
        the drive letter you want to log onto. QuickView will attempt to
        change to the desired drive. If an error occurs, QuickView will
        remain logged onto the current drive.

 F1   : Help

 F2   : Display information about the processor, detected graphics card,
        sound card and free memory.

 F3 or
 ALT-I: Get information on the currently selected file.

 ALT-O: Change options of QuickView. For details see below.

  + - : Increase or decrease resolution respectively. The currently
        selected resolution is highlighted. "Automatic" automatically
        selects the lowest resolution which will display the whole picture
        if possible.

 Space: Tag/untag the current file

 ALT-T: Tag all files in the current directory

 ALT-U: Untag all files.

 ALT-A: Show all 32*32 pixel Windows icons in the current directory. You
        can use a higher resolution to see more icons on the screen.

 ALT-X: Exit QuickView and return to DOS.


Options:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Press the red characters to toggle the state of the option. You can also
use the up/down arrow keys and the Space bar. If you press "C" a configu-
ration file is created or updated. Command line options override the config
file. Note that changing the use of VESA is only effective if you leave
QuickView and start it again.

AVI options:
Sound support: Sound through a Sound Blaster does not cost much time but
  sound through PC speaker might slow the system down noticably. If you
  have problems during AVI playback try turning off the sound.
AVI loop: Use this if you want an AVI to start again after viewing.
2x Zoom: QuickView will display AVIs twice as big and so allow full screen
  playback for appropriate AVI resolutions. Note that 2x Zoom might require
  a higher screen resolution and therefore the AVI will not appear bigger
  if this is the case. 2x Zoom is very CPU intensive and might slow down
  your system, so QuickView will therefore use at most HiColor output if
  2x Zoom is selected.
320*240 mode: Many AVIs have the size 320*240. QuickView will display these
  AVIs full screen if you switch on this option. 160*120 AVIs will also be
  displayed full screen if you also switch on 2x Zoom. Note that 320*240
  mode is only available with 256 color modes. 320*240 is a non-standard
  VGA mode and may cause problems with some graphics cards or if you use
  QuickView with other operating systems.
AVI quality: These options depend on the codec used in the AVIs:
Grey scale: This is only available for Cinepak and Ultimotion compressed
  AVIs as only these can be speeded up. If you use this option with AVIs
  using another codec QuickView will use 8 color bits output.
8 color bits: This option is available for all codecs.
HiColor: QuickView will use HiColor output with Cinepak compressed AVIs and
  will give the best quality for all other codecs.
TrueColor: Will give the best quality for all codecs.


Commands While Viewing:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

For all file types:
  Esc: Stop viewing.

For pictures:
  Arrow keys: Scroll picture if it is larger than the screen.
  Ctrl-Arrow keys: Scroll fast.
  Home, End: Scroll to left or right border respectively.
  Enter or Tab: View next file.
  Backspace: View previous file.

For AVI:
  Space: Pause Viewing, space again: next frame, any other key: continue.
  Arrow-key left, right: forward, rewind respectively.
  CTRL-Arrow-key left, right: fast forward, rewind respectively.


Questions & Answers:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

-Q: QuickView doesn't detect my sound card.
 A: Make sure that your BLASTER environment variable is set correctly.
    There must be a command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT like this:
      SET BLASTER=Axxx Ix Dx Hx Pxxx Tx
    with
    A: Sound Blaster base I/O-port,
    I: interrupt,
    D: DMA low channel,
    H: DMA high channel (only required for SB16),
    P: MIDI port,
    T: Sound Blaster Type (not necessary for QuickView)

-Q: I don't hear sound with some AVIs.
 A: Some AVIs don't have the audio separated into pieces, so QuickView must
    load the audio beforehand to XMS. If there is not enough memory
    available then the audio is omitted. I some cases it helps to reduce
    the number of colors.

-Q: The AVI stops after first frame.
 A: Try command line option /I to turn off Auto Init DMA.

-Q: Sound is interrupted with some AVIs.
 A: At least one component of your system is too slow.
    Try copying the AVI to your hard disk if you play it back from CD.
    Switch off 2x Zoom. Choose a lower number of colors.

-Q: I use PC speaker output because I don't have a sound card. I always
    hear clicks with AVIs when the program reads from the hard disc or from
    CD ROM.
 A: To allow good PC speaker sound 100% CPU time is required. This works
    with VOCs and WAVs but of course not with AVIs. Each time the program
    accesses the hard drive or a CD-ROM the sound must be interrupted.
    Windows does not support PC speaker sound with AVIs!

-Q: Why is the video quality bad with some AVIs?
 A: This is because you don't have a TrueColor or HiColor card or you don't
    have a VESA driver in your system. In the latter case you should use
    the VESA TSR for your graphics card, UNIVESA or UNIVBE, available on
    many FTP-servers, BBSs, from Shareware distributors or on my WWW page.
    The VESA driver must conform at least to version 1.2 of the VESA
    standard. Versions prior to 1.2 of the VESA standard did not define
    TrueColor and HiColor modes.

-Q: I get the message "Your system doesn't have enough main memory to show
    the file" with some AVIs. What can I do?
 A: Select a lower number of colors, e.g. HiColor instead of TrueColor.
    Turn off sound.

-Q: I can't forward and rewind AVIs.
 A: Either the AVI has no index or a bad index. Or there is not enough
    memory.

-Q: I like 50 lines menus more. How can I select this mode permanently?
 A: Press ALT-O in the menu. Then you can select 50 lines with "5" and
    write a config file with "C".

-Q: What do I have to do to make QuickView run under OS/2
 A: You have to set the following definitions for the DOS session:
    INT_DURING_IO: ON
    IDLE_SENSIVITY: 100
    HW_TIMER: ON
    Make sure the BLASTER environment variable is set properly.

-Q: What is a codec?
 A: Video and audio sequences are compressed and decompressed by routines
    called codecs (short for compressor/decompressor). A codec is
    responsible for compressing raw video or audio data into a format
    suitable for distribution. When you play the compressed video or audio
    sequence, the codecs integrated in QuickView perform a reverse role,
    converting the compressed data into images or sound that can be played
    on your system.


Known problems:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

- The Indeo codecs used in some AVIs are not supported yet. Indeo support
  is in the works.
- 16 bit MS Video 1 compressed AVIs in 8 color bit mode can't be displayed
  2x zoomed or using 320*240 mode.
