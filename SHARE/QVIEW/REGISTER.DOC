QuickView registration information
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

QuickView is distributed as shareware. You are welcome to test QuickView
without charge for an evaluation period of three weeks. If you continue to
use it after the trial period, you are obligated to register by paying a
license fee. If you obtained this program from a Shareware distributor you
have paid only for the service of copying; you have not paid for the
program itself. The author receives no portion of the price you may have
paid to the distributor for the disk. Shareware is a way for you to "try
before you buy". It is not "free" or "public domain". It is not software
you can quietly avoid paying for. If you like this program then please
register.

When you register, you'll get:
- Latest registered version of QuickView, with reference to "unregistered"
  removed, plus any enhancements that have been added since this version
  was released. You will receive your version on disk via snail mail (the
  rest of the disk is filled with sample files) or UUencoded via email
  (don't forget to give your email address!). In the latter case you can
  save the money for shipping and handling of course. Default disk size
  is 3.5" (1.44 Mb), 5.25" (1.2 Mb) is available on request.
- Further functions (see QV.DOC)
- Free support from the author via email.
- Notification of updates through email.
- Avoid that feeling of GUILT!

All updates are free (except disk, shipping and handling) provided the
registration fee hasn't changed. You can also send me a floppy disk with
a self-addressed and stamped mailer from within Germany (please include
sufficient funds in International Postage Coupons, otherwise) or you can
request it UUencoded via email.

A QuickView registration is only valid for use on a single CPU. If you want
to use QuickView on several computers you must register it for each one.
For prices see ORDER.FRM.

Please ask for the conditions of
- Multiple licences and site licenses.
- Dealer pricing.
- Special versions tailored to your application.
  One modification could be a Multimedia presentation program including AVI
  without Windows! This might be interesting for business.

All prices and conditions are subject to change without notice.


How to register:

You will find a complete order form in the file "ORDER.FRM". Load it into
any text editor and complete the form or print it first and complete it
manually (If you do so please write legibly). You can print the form by
typing "copy order.frm prn" at the DOS prompt. If you don't have a printer
write everything manually on a sheet.

Mail the completed form together with a check, cash (for details see
below) to:

Wolfgang Hesseler
Neustadter Str. 6
53547 Rossbach
Germany

If a new version will be released within a few weeks I will wait with the
delivery of your registered version till then. If you'd like to get it
immediately please note this on the registration form. If you give an email
address you will be notified when your registration arrives.


Payment:

There are several possibilities:
- Cash: Either in DM (Deutsche Mark) or Dollars ($US).
- Eurocheque (inside Europe). The amount must be in DM.
- International Postal Money Order. You go to your local post office and
  tell them: I want to send Wolfgang Hesseler in Germany xx Deutschmarks.
  They will give you a form to fill out, the postal clerk will look at the
  conversion table and you will pay the equivalent in your own currency.
  Some days later my postman brings me the money.
- Foreign cheque (+ $10US). This kind of cheques involves high costs for
  me, therefore you have to add $10US surcharge. You should only use this
  way if you think that cash is too dangerous and all other ways are
  impossible for you.
For more ways see the German REGISTER.DOK as they are only possible inside
Germany.

If you pay cash or by cheque please make sure that it is not visible
through the envelope.

If you are doubtful please ask. You may write to the address above or
send me an email:
  hesseler@athene.informatik.uni-bonn.de
