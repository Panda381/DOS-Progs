WHY HAP ?
        I introduced something new early 1992 by distributing HAP&PAH 2.10.
        The comments I got clearly showed that HAP needed to grow.
        Although the HAP project no longer had top priority I decided to
        pursue the development of a multi-file archiver anyway.
        This program is a new release, if I receive enough supporting
        comments (and money) I will continue to spend time on it.


HANDS-DOWN ?
        Hap usually compresses better than ARJ from Robert Jung
        and also better than PKWARE's PKZIP 1.93alpha, a pre-release of
        their soon-to-be released version 2 - something,
        both are very good programs.


SPEED
        Hap was deliberately kept small so virtually all of its code would
        fit into the 80486's internal on-chip cache (which is 8Kb).
        Almost all of Hap's DATA fits into the second-level cache of a
        486 board. Both these facts should enable Hap to run as efficiently
        as possible on an 80486 equipped machine with 256Kb cache.
        Hap was designed for 80286 and higher CPUs.

BUGS !
        This version was released for tactical reasons.
        So it still contains a few known 'bugs' related to screen-output and
        aborted files.
        The compression and decompression algorithm work FINE, no bugs to the
        best of my knowledge. I compressed a lot of files and all came back
        without a single bit changed.
        You may compare (renamed) original and uncompressed files by using
        fc.com which you may find on your DOS disks. Remember to add
        the /b switch, see your DOS manual for more information.

        If you find anything weird that does not relate to screen-output
        send me a message.
        Note that the file format of Hap 2.10 was rudimentary, the revised
        format Hap 3.00 uses should be stable, I have made provisions for
        expansion features in the future. Yes, it means 2.10 files are
        incompatible with Hap 3.00 and vice versa (the internal structure
        differs as well due to an algorithm improvement).


CONTACTING THE AUTHOR:

        ILINK   : HARALD FELDMANN

        Mail    : Hamarsoft
                  P.O. Box 91
                  6114 ZH  Susteren
                  The Netherlands

        In case you send me physical mail:
        I prefer receiving physical mail at the P.o. Box address rather than
        at the 'Beatrixlaan' since that address may change in the near future.
        The P.o. Box will be maintained in that case.

        over ilink, send your message in the international COMPRESS echo,
        I should be able to pick it up there.


RAMCRAM ?
        Not anymore ! You should now be able to run Hap and Pah with 376 Kb
        free memory. Hap and Pah should accept files of any size and compress
        and decompress them successfully.


MONEY ?
        You are encouraged to support me by returning the registration form
        and an amount of USD $20,- to the P.O. box address to stimulate
        further development of Hap and Pah. Please do not take the text on the
        registration form as offensive, I just don't like to get into any
        legal trouble.
        I think it's fair enough to oblige businesses, governmental and
        educational institutions to register and send a gift of USD$ 20,-
        within the 30 day evaluation period.
        Just for the record: the HAP 2.10 discount offer hereby expires.


SYNTAX

ADDING FILES TO AN ARCHIVE

        <must-supply text> [additional filespecs]
        do not type the <> or [].

        <HAP> <a> <haparch> [drive:][\path\]<filespec1> [filespec2 filespec3 ..]

        adds the files on drive:\path\filespec to haparch. You may specify any
        filename for haparch even with extensions. Hap will cut off the
        extension, if any, and add .HAP itself.
        Hap 3.00 does not store subdirectories and does not search any within
        another. Note that the <a>, <haparch> AND <filespec1> MUST be supplied.
        Meaning 'add all files in the current directory to HAPPY.HAP' is done
        by:

        HAP a HAPPY *.*

        Aborting compression leaving the already compressed files intact in
        the archive is done by pressing ESC or CTRL-C.

EXTRACTING FILES FROM AN ARCHIVE

        <PAH> <e> <haparch> <filespec> [filespec2 filespec3 ...]

        extracts filespec and additional filespecs from haparch to the current
        directory. Note that filespec MUST be supplied, meaning 'recall all
        files in HAPPY.HAP' is done by:

        PAH e HAPPY *.*

        In order to get your files extracted to a specific directory, move to
        that directory, run the Pah program in its home directory and extract
        from haparch in its home directory.

        .....................................................................
        Example:
        PAH is in C:\UTIL\PAH.EXE
        HAPARCH is in D:\HEY\MORE\ME\HAPARCH.HAP
        you want your *.exe and *.com files to be extracted to E:\NEXT\MORE\

        you would: move to E:\NEXT\MORE
        then type: C:\UTIL\PAH e D:\HEY\MORE\ME\HAPARCH *.exe *.com
        in either upper or lower case.
        .....................................................................
        To date, PAH extracts to the current 'working' directory, a future
        version may incorporate redirection.


LISTING FILES IN AN ARCHIVE

        <HAP> or <PAH> <l> <haparch> <filespec> [filespec2 filespec3 ...]

        Lists filespec and additional filespecs within haparch. Use the
        'Pause' key or CTRL-S on the AT keyboard to pause the scrolling.


DELETING FILES IN AN ARCHIVE

        <HAP> or <PAH> <d> <haparch> <filespec> [filespec2 filespec3 ...]

WARNING
!       Deletes filespec and additional filespecs from haparch without a
!       second chance. Be sure to know what you're doing, Hap and pah do NOT
!       create a second copy of your original archive ! So PCTOOLS et al
!       won't work to get anything back... Make BACKUPS !
