
           To all HAP users who wish to register and send me money:



Dear HAP users,


I sincerely appreciate your efforts to get your version registered. Thank you !

I can imagine you want to make sure your money reaches the right person.
To ensure safety you may wish to send checks, postal checks or other 
means of payment. I appreciate and share your concern for safety. However, 
cashing checks (especially foreign checks) is expensive over here and some
checks are not being accepted (like postal checks).
An alternative would be to enclose paper money within the registration form
and send it as a letter through registered mail to my P.O. Box.

If you decide to send a check (or money order), I unfortunately have to ask
you to add USD$ 15,- processing charges to your check or money order amount
to cover bank costs. In this case, please make it payable to "Harald Feldmann".


In order to make it easier for you to register and support me financially I
have set up the following list so you can send your own local currency.
 
Country:			Currency:	     Amount:


Australia			Australian Dollars     40,00
Austria				Austrian Shilling     400,00
Belgium				Belgian Francs	      600,00
Canada				Canadian Dollars       30,00
Denmark				Danish Crowns	      200,00
Finland				Finnish Marks	      200,00
France				French Francs	      200,00
Germany				Deutschmarks	       30,00
Greece				Greek Drachme	    4.000,00
Ireland				Irish Pounds	       20,00
Italy				Italian Lire       40.000,00
Japan				Japanese YEN        4.000,00
Netherlands			Dutch Guilders	       30,00
Norway				Norwegian Crown	      200,00
Portugal			Portugese Escudo    4.000,00
Spain				Spanish Pesetas     4.000,00
Sweden				Swedish Crowns        200,00
Switzerland			Swiss Francs           40,00
United Kingdom			British Pounds	       10,00
United States of America	US Dollars	       20,00


These amounts usually represent a fair approximation of USD $20,-
In some cases it may be cheaper to convert to US dollars or Dutch guilders
I apologize for that, I listed paper-money values.

NEVER send coins, please.

The fact that I can accept money only in the currencies listed should in
no way imply I boycott or disapprove of other countries or other currencies.
I simply will not be able to convert it.
All amounts sent will be considered gifts to stimulate further development
of the Hap and Pah programs.


I hope to have made things easier for you by this arrangement.

Many thanks.

Harald Feldmann, November 15, 1992.
