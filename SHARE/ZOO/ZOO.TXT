 -----------------------------  O     don't ask "Overwrite?"
  q     be quiet                p     pipe extracted data to standard output
  :     don't store dir names   /,//  extract full pathnames
  .     pack to current dir     I     add filenames read from stdin
  C     show file CRC value     +/-   enable/disable generations
  S     overwrite newer files   g     list generation limits

  C     change archive cmnt     h     use high-compression method


command line format:
  zoo {command}[options] archive files(s)

Commands:
 a  add files
    u - update, replace only if file is newer than saved version
    n - new, add if file is not in archive
    f - fast, don't compress at all
    h - high performance compressor, slower than default
    M - move files to archive, delete after saving
    c - add a comment to each file added
    C - add a comment to the archive as a whole
    : - strip directory names, save filenames only
    q - quiet (qq suppresses warnings, qqq suppresses nonfatal errors too)
    P - pack after adding, remove overwritten or deleted files
        (leaves a .bak file, use PP to overwrite it)
    I - read filenames from standard input
    + - enable generations
 e  extract files
 x  extract files
    : - extract to current directory (ignore pathnames)
    . - make absolute pathnames relative to current directory
        (name /etc/hosts becomes ./etc/hosts)
    / - extract to subdirs, // create subdirs as needed - default
        (the sequence :/ may be used to use but not create subdirs)
    q - quiet
    d - extract deleted files, too. dd extract *only* deleted files
    N - extract to nowhere. Used to test the archive with xN or xNq
    p - extract for pipe to standard output. Use q to avoid header
    O - overwrite without asking
    S - overwrite superceded (newer) files
 l  list archive info
 L  list info for multiple archives
 v  list verbose file info and archive comment
 V  list verbose file info, archive and file comments
    v - verbose (same as v command, used with L for multiple files
    V - verbose with file comments
    C - show CRC
    a - show archive name in file listing (useful with L)
    d - show deleted files
    q - quiet, shows only file info, no comments or headers
    f - fast, lists only filename, no pathname, multiple columns
    1 - one column output (for the f option)

 c  comment changes, change or add comments to listed files
    (changes all file comments if no files given)
    A - only change archive comment

 P  pack archive, remove deleted or overwritten files
    E - erase the .bak file when done

 D  delete files by name
    P - pack after deletion, use PP if .bak file exists
    q - quiet

 T  timestamp adjust, make archive age of newest file

 g  generation commands
    l - set generation limit on files
    A - apply limit to archive rather than a file (with gl)

 f  filter, copy stdin to stdout with [de]compression
    c - compress
    u - uncompress
    h - use the high compression method

Examples:

# just add a few files
    zoo a arch file1 files
# add C source files in subdirectories
    zoo a test part1/*.c part2/*.c
# add documentation files with high compression
    zoo ah test *.doc

# extract all files
    zoo x test
# extract files into the current directory
    zoo x: test
# extract a single file and sort before listing
    zoo xp test users.lst | sort

# list the contents and archive comments
    zoo v arch
# list all files in all archives
    zoo L xxx.zoo /doc/*.zoo ../*.zoo
