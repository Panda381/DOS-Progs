SND2WAV
תתתתתתת

SND2WAV is a external program which carry out the conversion of raw audio data
files to Windows WAV format. Raw is not added to Convert like a new format
because Convert uses header info from the input file to obtain its format,
and raw formats haven't header.

SND2WAV would be used if Convert fails. It supports multiple options in command
line to determinate parameters of the file (i.e. samplerate, resolution...).

        Sintaxis:  SND2WAV InputPath [-Option(s)]
                   Options :
                            -i,-m   Sets Intel or Motorola Mode
                            -8,-16  Sets 8 or 16 Bits Mode
                            -s,-u   Sets Signed or Unsigned Mode
                            -1,-2   Sets Mono or Stereo Mode
                            -f#n    Sets Sample Rate (in Hz)
                            -b#n    Sets Begin of Data (in Bytes)
                            -l#n    Sets Length of Data (in Bytes)

        Defaults are Intel, 8 Bits, Unsigned, Mono, 44100 Hz and Begin at 0

InputPath accepts standard DOS wildcards to specify various files to convert.

If you don't known how the file is, you can test with varios options, until
the resulting file sound well.

This utility is used commonly inside a batch file:

        REM FILE: cd2wav.bat
        REM Converts raw audio data from a CD into a WAV file
        SND2WAV %1 -m -16 -s -2 -f44100 -b0



JOIN
תתתת

Commonly, large sampler files are cut into smaller pieces to save them into
disquettes. JOIN simply lets link these pieces to obtain the original large
file.

In this version, JOIN supports only Kurzweil and Ensoniq files. In order to
join all pieces together, they would be renamed to a same name and a extension
like ".KR?" or ".IN?", where ? indicates a index. The resulting file will have
".KRZ" or ".INS".

        Sintaxis:  JOIN FileName.[KRZ/INS/EFE]

Example: JOIN heavy.ins will read from heavy.in1, heavy.in2 ...
         JOIN chanter.krz will read from chanter.kr1, chanter.kr2 ...
