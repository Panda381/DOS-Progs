AIN 2.2  Copyright (c) 1993  InfoService Ltd.
A new archiver.  In some cases it compresses  two  times better than the well-
known ARJ 2.41, to which it is similar by the features  provided.  It is  also
faster then all other archivers.

     Archiver's options constantly used are recommended to be stored  into the
AIN_SW enviroment variable. For example, you might want to place the command:

			     SET AIN_SW=/WC:

into  autoexec.bat  in  order to  avoid  "Disk full" message  when updating an
archive on a floppy disk.
