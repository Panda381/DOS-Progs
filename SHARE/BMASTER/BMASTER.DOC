BLASTER Master is a program designed for serious PC
soundcard enthusiasts who are interested in getting the most
from their PC audio cards when sampling sounds and then
playing them back.  A tool kit for working with Sound
Blaster type VOC, .WAV and .SND files, BLASTER Master offers
many features that are available on Digital Audio
Workstations which normally cost many thousands of dollars.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ---------------
  Before  running  BLASTER  Master on your PC,  please  check  the  system
  requirements and user information listed below:

     >  This  program requires EGA/VGA graphics, a mouse,  a  hard
      disk and at least a 286 PC.
     
     >  NOTE:  BLASTER  Master will function without  a  soundcard
      being present, but the PLAY, RECORD and SCOPE functions will
      be disabled.
     
     >   BLASTER Master includes internal driver support for Sound
      Blaster  compatibles but most other sound cards can be  used
      by   installing   your   cards  DOS  based   player/recorder
      utilities.  See the section on Configuring External  Players
      for detailed information on this.
     
     >  Unregistered versions will only process a 25 second  sound
      file  while  the  registered version will process  any  size
      sound file.

  More  requirements and performance tips for using BLASTER Master can  be
  found  in the section entitled "Performance Tips" (near the end  of  the
  documentation).

OVERVIEW ---------------
  One  of the great features of the Sound Blaster and other PC audio cards
  is  the  ability to sample sound and play it back.  Now you  can  tailor
  your  own  sound  files using the BLASTER Master program,  a  very  fast
  EGA/VGA  graphic editor. Useless and noisy sample data (at the beginning
  and  endings  of  VOC files) can be quickly removed  and  sections  from
  within  the sample can be saved as a new sample file.  A graphic of  the
  entire  sample  appears on your monitor along with a grid  that  divides
  the  sample into seconds to aid in selecting the "cut points".  A  zero-
  crossing/phase approximation method allows you to select  the  displayed
  bytes,  helping you choose the "cleanest" points for processing.  Cross-
  fading is applied to splice points when needed.

  During playback, a pulsing index line displays the position of the  file
  being  played. The various digital processes can be selected  using  the
  mouse,  or in most cases, you can use ALT plus the first letter  of  the
  option.
     
     > Example: ALT-P (holding down the ALT key while pressing the
      "P"  at  the  same time) will "PLAY" the currently  selected
      sound file.

  A   color   palette  is  also  included  in  BLASTER  Master's   graphic
  capabilities.  Using  your  keyboard's function  keys  F1-F10,  you  can
  control  the  colors  displayed  on the screen.  Play  around  with  the
  available color combinations to find the one that best suits you! For  a
  listing  of  the  function  key color settings,  refer  to  the  section
  entitled "Changing Screen Colors" .

  Functions  of  a sound file -- SELECTing, RECORDing and EDITing  --  are
  covered in the following four sections.

SELECTING A SOUND FILE ---------------
  If  you  don't  specify a sound file when starting the  editor,  a  file
  selection  dialog box will appear. The current path can  be  changed  by
  selecting  the right selection box and selecting a new path.  From  this
  dialog  box,  you  can PLAY the sound file, RECORD  a  new  sound  file,
  ACCEPT  the file to process or QUIT the program, returning to  DOS.  You
  can  also display useful file information to audition a file by choosing
  the  PLAY  option. The various options can be selected using  the  mouse
  or,  in  most cases, pressing <ALT> plus the first letter of the  option
  as  explained  earlier. You can also select files  with  your  mouse  by
  double-clicking on the file you want to access. If you  accept  a  sound
  file that is multi-blocked, BLASTER Master will allow you to remove  the
  blocks and convert to a RAW VOC file.

IMPORTING A SOUND FILE ---------------
  Choosing  certain  sound  files  other than  VOC  files  from  the  File
  Selection  Dialog Box will allow you to import WAV, NTI, 8SV, MOD,  SAM,
  VOX and SND format files into BLASTER Master.
     
     >  WAV  files  are the Microsoft Multi-Media format  and  are
      supported  by the Pro Audio Spectrum and the ATI Stereo  F/X
      sound cards and others.
     
     >  SND  files:  completely raw wave data files not  including
      header information.
     
     >  NTI & SAM files are Amiga sample files as used by MOD file
      editors.
     
     > VOC type files can also be saved in these three formats.
     
     > 8SV: the extension normally used for Amiga IFF sound files.
      You  can  import Amiga IFF sound files, but cannot currently
      save files in Amiga IFF format.
     
     >  MOD: only the samples from a MOD file can be extracted for
      editing.
     
     > VOX files are sample files made by voice mail type cards. A
      sample  rate  of  6750 is assumed. You  can  use  the  PITCH
      function to quickly adjust this.

SOUND FILE UTILITIES ---------------
  When  you  select UTILITY from the File Selection Dialog Box,  the  File
  Utility  Dialog  Box  appears. This useful  option  will  allow  you  to
  DELETE,  RENAME,  COPY  or MOVE the selected sound  file.  You  can  not
  choose  this  option  unless you have selected a file.  When  using  the
  RENAME,  COPY or MOVE functions, you will need to supply a DOS  path  in
  the  TO: input box. You can not RENAME a sound file unless the new  name
  does  not  exist in the current path. COPY will warn you if you  attempt
  to  over-write an existing file. The MOVE function is very handy in that
  it  will move the sound file from one path to another. The MOVE function
  is particularly fast when the new path exists on the same disk drive.

RECORDING A SOUND FILE ---------------
  When  you  select RECORD from the File Selection Dialog Box, the  Record
  Dialog  Box  appears. Here, enter the name of the VOC file you  wish  to
  record.
     
     > NOTE: If specifying a VOC file that already exists, it will
      be overwritten!
  
  Using  a  mouse, select the sample rate to use when recording--  13,000-
  4000  if using Sound Blaster or 44,000-4000 if using Sound Blaster  Pro.
  (The  higher  the  sample rate, the better the file  will  sound.)  When
  using  the  various digital processes, a higher rate will  produce  much
  better sounding file. Choose SCOPE to display a graphic scope, which  is
  very  useful  for  setting the volume on a device  from  which  you  are
  recording.  Select RECORD when ready to begin recording and  <ESC>  when
  ready  to stop. Your file is then displayed on the Editor screen so  you
  can modify it.
     
> NOTE: Sound Blaster Pro and SB16 users will also select
the recording input source, input filter, and MONO or STEREO
recording. Users of CDROM drives need to read about Syncro
CD sampling.
USING SYNCRO CD ---------------
  Anyone  using  a  CDROM from Creative Labs MultiMedia  can  use  BLASTER
  Master  to  sample recordings directly from your favorite  CDs!  I  have
  gotten  excellent  (if not the BEST) recordings with the  Sound  Blaster
  Pro using the CDROM.
  If  you are equipped with a CDROM, a standard CD player control bar will
  appear  on the RECORD dialog box you see on your monitor. BLASTER Master
  currently  supports  the following CD player controls  --  PLAY,  PAUSE,
  STOP,  REWIND,  FAST FORWARD, PREVIOUS TRACK and NEXT TRACK.  To  sample
  from  your favorite CDs, make sure you have selected "CD" as your  input
  source.  You  can either start the CD and then pick RECORD,  or  what  I
  have found works better is to use SYNCRO CD, as explained below.

  If  BLASTER  Master detects that your CDROM is in PAUSE  mode,  you  can
  select  RECORD  to  automatically synchronize the sampling  and  the  CD
  audio  playback. When you press <ESC> to stop recording, the CD playback
  will  shut off automatically. Using this SYNCRO CD feature, your results
  are  a very precise, high quality sample that should require very little
  editing.
     
EDITING A SOUND FILE ---------------
  The  EDIT option enables you to edit selected sections of a sound  file.
  When  selecting  a  sound file section to edit (remove,  save,  hear  or
  zoom),  position  the  cursor over the graph at the  first  desired  cut
  point  and  press the LEFT mouse button. Now, position the  cursor  over
  the  second  cut  point and press the LEFT button again.  This  marks  a
  section with a blue box, signifying that you can PLAY that section,  CUT
  it from the sample or SAVE it as a new file.
  The  ZOOM  option displays the marked section so you can  choose  a  new
  block  from  the  zoomed  area, editing the  sound  file  with  surgical
  precision. (You can zoom the file until the resolution reaches 1:1.  The
  current resolution is shown just above the options selection box.)   The
  UNZOOM  option  will back up to the last marked block.  You  can  UNZOOM
  upto 128 times or until the original BLOCK is once again reached.
     
     >  MOVE: allows a selected block to be moved to a new section
      in the same file.
     >  COPY:  (Vanishing Menu only) moves a copy of the  selected
      block to a new section of the same file.
     >  FULLVIEW:  (Vanishing Menu only) displays the entire  file
      with the current block highlighted. This is very useful when
      zoomed  into  a  block  and  you need  to  view  the  entire
      waveform.

SETTING A MARKER ---------------
  BLASTER  Master  features a marker function which  allows  you  to  pre-
  select  a  point in a sound ile. This function is especially useful  for
  mixing  and  inserting sounds in sound files. To set a marker,  position
  the  mouse cursor at the appropriate spot on the blue bar just below the
  sound  file  grid.  Then, using the right mouse button,  click  on  this
  position to place a white arrow on this blue bar. The SPACEBAR and arrow
  keys can also be used to position the marker. Pressing "M" sets a block.

TOOLS ---------------
  This  program includes special processes, called tools, that operate  on
  a  block  of  data. When you select the TOOLS button, a  selection  menu
  containing  special block functions pops up on your screen.  These  tool
  functions are listed below:

     LOOP:
     Repeats  block  up  to 10 times, adding a  Max  Headroom-type
      stutter to the file.

     MUTE:
     Replaces  the block with silence bytes, which is very  useful
      for  removing glitches and other undesirable noises  without
      effecting the playback time.
     
     REVERSE:
     Reverses the block to playback backwards.
     
     PITCH:
     Changes the pitch of the block (lowering/raising it); effects
      playback time.
     
     ECHO:
     Adds  echo  to the block. Same parameters as in Echo function
      for whole files.
     
     VOLUME:
     Adjusts  the block's playback volume. Same parameters  as  in
      Volume function
     for whole files.
     
     ACCELERATE:
     Increases  the playback speed of the block for a  speeded  up
      effect.
     
     DECELERATE:
     Decreases  the playback speed of the block for a slowed  down
      effect.


SPECIAL PROCESSES ---------------
  BLASTER  Master supports several special digital processes for modifying
  your  sound  files:  SCOPE,  ECHO, REVERSE, INSERT,  FAST,  SLOW,  RATE,
  VOLUME,  PITCH,  PACK,  FADE, VOCALS, PANNING, OCTAVIA  and  MIXER.  The
  processes  are  not  all displayed at the same time  on  the  Wave  Edit
  screen,  so  to display the next set of options, press the MORE  button.
  Once  again,  options  here are selected using the  mouse  or,  in  most
  cases, pressing <ALT> plus the first letter of the option you want.
     
     >   EXAMPLE:  ALT-E  (holding  down  the  ALT  and  "E"  keys
      simultaneously) allows you to "ECHO" the currently  selected
      sound file.
  
  You  can  use  the NEW button to select a new file when  in  the  Editor
  screen  or  to  unmark  a  block when in the Cut/Save/Zoom  screen.  The
  special processes listed above are described in detail as follows:
SCOPE:
  Graphically  displays  sample input real-time. To see  this  first-hand,
  speak  into  a  microphone and see what your voice looks  like  or  play
  music directly into the Sound Blaster. (This works particularly well  on
  faster  machines  and  is  an  excellent  way  to  check  your  system's
  quality.) When there is no sound input, you should see a straight,  flat
  line  that  is exactly even with the white line on the sound file  grid.
  Any  spikes  you see above or below this white line indicate  that  your
  system is registering noise of some kind. Pressing any key or either  of
  the mouse buttons will cancel the scope and return you to the editor.

ECHO:
  Adds  echo  or  delay to a VOC file to give it a richer,  fuller  sound.
  This  feature  is also great for adding special effects. Two  parameters
  are used to determine the type of echo desired:
     
     1)  SIZE  --  The "size" of the effect is determined  by  the
      number of milliseconds before the echo starts. Delays of 60-
      100  simulate a large room, while larger delays (up  to  200
      milliseconds) will sound like a cavern or canyon.
     
     2)  MIXTURE -- The mixture (how loud the echo should be mixed
      in)  has  an  effect on the type of echo desired.  A  30-60%
      mixture will sound more realistic than using a higher volume
      for  the  delayed  sounds. To determine how  the  echo  will
      repeat, select either INFINITE or FINITE.

REVERSE:
  Reverses  the playback of a VOC file, which is effectively the  same  as
  playing  a  tape backwards. You older Beatles fans can see for  yourself
  if  the  song  "Number 9" really says "turn me on, dead man"  backwards.
  This  is  also  a great tool for televangelists to use in searching  for
  those  pesky satanic references in rock & roll songs! Did you know  that
  the famous Tarzan yell sounds the same backwards as forwards? Try it!

INSERT:
  Allows  another sound file to be inserted into the sound  file  you  are
  currently  editing. When you select INSERT, the File Select  Dialog  Box
  will  appear. From here, you can SELECT a VOC file, RECORD a  new  sound
  file  or  CANCEL the INSERT process and return to the Edit screen.  Once
  you  have  selected a VOC file for insertion, the system will  give  you
  the option of selecting the point in the original file for insertion  by
  using  either the mouse pointer, the marker, a sample point in the  file
  or  a point in time.  If the sample rate of the new sound file does  not
  match  the original file, the sample rate will be adjusted to  blend  in
  correctly.
     
     >  NOTE: Use care when selecting a new sound file that is not
      packed,  contains  silence compression or is  a  multi-block
      file. The resulting sound file will not be usable!

SLOW:
  Extends the time domain without effecting the frequency domain... or  in
  plain English, the SLOW process allows you to re-sample a VOC file  that
  will  play back at the selected speed without effecting the pitch.  This
  function  will double the size of the original sound file.  Imagine  you
  are  a guitar player and want to learn the latest white hot guitar licks
  from  Joe  Satriani or Eric Johnson... SLOW makes listening and learning
  MUCH   easier!  It  is  also  very  useful  for  preparing   multi-media
  presentations.
     
     >  HINT: Sound files with sample rates above 12khz produce  a
      more natural sound.
FAST:
  I  couldn't  have a "slow down" process without a "speed up"  one,  too,
  could  I?  Unlike  SLOW,  the  FAST  process  includes  a  "slider"  for
  selecting  how  much of a speed increase you desire. This function  will
  decrease the size of the original sound file accordingly.
     
     >  HINT:  Like  SLOW,  sound files with higher  sample  rates
      produce better results.

RATE:
  Allows  a VOC file created with a high sample rate to be "down"  sampled
  to  a  lower sample rate. Some PCs have problems playing VOC files  with
  the  higher sample rates, so this RATE process provides you with  a  way
  to  change the sample rate to something more compatible with your PC. It
  is  also  a  good  way  to  make files smaller without  the  degradation
  associated with compression.
     
     >  A  VOC  file recorded at 12,000Hz+ down-sampled to  8000Hz
      will  probably  sound better than if it had been  originally
      recorded at the slower rate.
     
     >  Sound files originally sampled on the MAC at 22,000Hz  can
      be  down-sampled to 12,000Hz or less with almost no loss  in
      clarity.
  
  The  RATE  process is also capable of "up" sampling, although  you  WILL
  NOT  gain any noticable resolution. Approximating the "missing" byte  is
  just not the same as having the original bytes in all cases.

VOLUME:
  Either  increases or decreases the amplitude of VOC files.  One  way  to
  get  a  very clean sample is to make your sample at a fairly low  volume
  and  then  re-sample  up to a higher volume. (The Sound  Blaster  has  a
  tendency  to  introduce distortion as you increase the volume  used  for
  sampling.)
  The  VOLUME process works very well for sampling directly from a  CD  or
  tape  deck.  Enter either "I" to increase the volume or "D" to  decrease
  the  volume.  The numeric value you enter after either "I" or  "D"  will
  determine the amount of change in the resulting file.
     
     > Increasing the volume: values of 10-50 have a subtle effect
      on  the resulting sound file. Values of 50-200+ will have an
      even more dramatic effect.
     
     >  Decreasing  the  volume: values of  1-99  will  cause  the
      resulting file to have approximately the same volume as  the
      percent of the number entered. Entering "50" will produce  a
      sound  file that is only 50% as loud as the original.  If  a
      value  greater than 100 is entered, the effect  will  be  to
      INCREASE the volume, even though you selected to DECREASE.

MIXER:
  Blends  two  VOC files into a single sample. There is also a volume  mix
  parameter  that  controls  how loud the mixed-in  sample  will  be.  The
  volume  mix can be a number between 1 and 100; 50 to 60 is often a  very
  good  mixing level. Before beginning the MIXing process, you can  select
  the  point within your original file where you want to begin mixing.  If
  you  want  to  start at the beginning of your file, choose the  farthest
  point to your left.
  
  The  Mixer  is  a great way to add special effects to your sound  files.
  This  process does not try to adjust the sample rates if the  files  are
  different.
PACK/UNPACK:
  These  processes will either pack or unpack a sound file,  depending  on
  its  current  state.  The previously-discussed functions  only  work  on
  unpacked  files. Many of the available files come packed; once unpacked,
  all of the special BLASTER Master features can be applied to the files.

PITCH:
  Alters the sample rate value contained within the VOC file. If you  want
  to  raise  or  lower the pitch, you can select the slider. Altering  the
  pitch  will also effect the playback time, but not the size of the file.
  This  process  comes  in handy when importing a WAV  or  SAM  file  (for
  instance) that does not quite sound right. Used with the FAST  and  SLOW
  processes, you can produce some very interesting effects.

FADE:
  Allows  you  to  fade in or out on the volume of a  sound  file  at  the
  file's  beginning  and ending points. When choosing this  function,  you
  can  specify the amount of time you want for the fade in and  fade  out.
  Neither  of  these times can exceed 1/2 of the total time of  the  sound
  file. If for instance, you wish to only fade out a sound file, use  zero
  as  the fade in time. When combining multiple files, a little fading can
  result  in a smoother transition in the sound, making the switch between
  sounds  less abrupt. This can be especially effective when a sound  file
  has lots of background noise and the joining sound file does not.

SILENCE:
  Inserts a period of silence into the sound file. This is very handy  for
  padding out multimedia sounds.

NOISE GATE:
  Mutes  background noise based on the Threshold value. This  function  is
  very effective with speech only sound files, others may sound choppy.

OCTAVIA:
  Mixes  in  a  second  waveform one octave above  or  below  the  current
  waveform.  This  is a very interesting effect for both voice  and  music
  sounds. It was named after the guitar effect that Jimi Hendrix used.
  
VOCALS: (Stereo files only)
  "Removes"  vocals  from  a  stereo sound  file.  This  process  actually
  inverts  the left channel 180 degrees and mixes it back into  the  right
  channel.  This has a tendency to cancel out all the center  waves  where
  vocals are often mixed in. The effect varies significantly from song  to
  song  depending  on how it was originally mixed. For  example,  "I  Feel
  Fine"  by  The  Beatles  will  process out 99%  of  the  vocal,  whereas
  "Eleanor Rigby" has the effect of enhancing the vocals and reducing  the
  cellos. You can also tweak the results by modifying the sampling  SOURCE
  --  that  is, play around with the channel balance and use  some  EQ  or
  even  stereo synthesis. In any case, VOCALS is lots of fun and works  as
  well as the $350 unit you see advertised.

PANNING: (Stereo files only)
  Adds  left  channel to right channel stereo panning or right channel  to
  left  channel stereo panning. In other words, it allows a sound file  to
  sweep from one speaker to the next.

MAKEMONO: (Stereo files only)
  This process converts a stereo file to monophonic. The two channels  can
  be  mixed together to form a single channel or either the left or  right
  channel  can  be selected to form a mono soundfile. This is very  useful
  for  people with soundcards that are MONO only or to reduce the size  of
  large stereo files.
USING THE VANISHING MENU ---------------
  The  system reveals a drop-down bar menu when, during file editing,  you
  move  the mouse cursor to the top of the screen or hold down the <SHIFT>
  key.  All of the button functions are available from the Vanishing Menu.
  Many other useful functions are also available, as explained below.

FILE MENU:
     >  SAVE  -- Save the current sound file. If the current sound
      file is UNTITLED, you will be prompted for a file name.
     >  SAVE  AS -- Save the current sound file by a new  name  or
      file format.
     >  QUIT -- Quit to DOS immediately. If the current sound file
      is UNTITLED, you will be prompted for a file name.

OPTIONS MENU:
     > LOOP PLAY ON/OFF -- Causes playback to be single or looped.
     >  SAVE SCREEN COLORS -- Saves the current screen colors. For
      more  details,  see the sections about Changing  and  Saving
      Default screen colors.
     >  BLOCK  PLAY ON/OFF (block edit only) -- Plays  either  the
      whole  sound  file or selected block. This function  is  not
      supported in ZOOM.
     >  UNDO  LAST EDIT/RETURN TO ORIGINAL -- This function undoes
      the last edit.
     >VOLUME  MIXER  -- Sound Blaster Pro and SB16 users  will  be
      able to set their mixer controls using this option.

HELP:
   Displays a short help file that briefly details the
various functions.

  You  can  access these menus quickly from the keyboard by using  <SHIFT>
  and  the  first  letter of each option: Shift-F for  FILE,  Shift-H  for
  HELP, etc.

CONFIGURING EXTERNAL PLAYERS ---------------
  Many  compatible  soundcards  only support  the  original  Soundblaster.
  Often  these cards sound better in native mode and offer better playback
  support  like stereo and 16bit files. Cards like the Pro Audio  Spectrum
  and  Advanced  Gravis Ultrasound (GUS) are good examples of  cards  with
  advanced features that seldom get support outside of Windows.
  SB16  users  can  also take advantage of the VOC and WAV file  utilities
  that are included with the bundled software.
  
  Selecting  the CONFIG option from the File Select dialog box allows  you
  to  set  up  four external options: a WAV file player, SND file  player,
  VOC  file player and a recorder program. You are not required to use ANY
  external  players if you do not want to. All soundcard  users  can  take
  good  advantage  of  the  WAV  and  SND  players.  Only  SB16  and  non-
  Soundblaster  users  should consider using the VOC file  player  option.
  The  external  players are set up exactly as if you  were  running  them
  from  the  DOS command line, with exception that BLASTER Master supports
  several  "variables"  for including information  about  the  file  being
  played.  These  variables will be filled in at  the  time  the  external
  player/recorder is accessed by BLASTER Master.
     
     Variable List:
     %F   = File Name
              Use  this variable to insert the selected file name.
     %R   = Sample Rate
              Use this variable to insert the sample rate
     %S   = Recording Source (CD/MIC/LINE)
              Use this variable to insert the RECORDING source
     %M   = Mode (STEREO/MONO)
              Use this variable to insert the RECORDING mode (STEREO or MONO)
     %M1  = Mode (-s)
              Use this variable to insert an "-s" if the  file  is
              STEREO (PAS-16 and GUS users, etc...)
     %M2  = Mode (S)
              Use this variable to insert an "S" if the file is STEREO (PAS-16 users, etc...)
     

  These  variable  options  should allow  you  to  support  most  external
  player/recorders  such as WPLAY, VPLAY, PLAY, PLAYFILE,  RECFILE,  VREC,
  etc...
  
  Here is an example for setting up WPLAY for the SB16:
     
     C:\SB16\VOCUTIL\WPLAY %F /Q
  
  This setting includes the full path name, the %F file name variable  and
  the  WPLAY  command  like switch "/Q" to suppress screen  output.  Sound
  Blaster  Pro  users would change the \SB16\ to \SBPRO\ or  whatever  the
  appropriate path is to WPLAY.EXE. You could also set up a .BAT  file  to
  run  the  program as well. Once properly set up, using the  PLAY  option
  from the File Select dialog will now allow you to audition WAV files!
  
  Here  in  an  example  for setting up PLAYFILE for the  PAS-16  to  play
  either WAV or VOC files:
  
     C:\PROAUDIO\PLAYFILE %F %M2
     
  This setting includes the full path name, the %F file name variable  and
  the  PLAYFILE command line switch to play the file as a STEREO file (S).
  The  "S"  will only be added if the file being played is a stereo  file.
  If  PLAYFILE does not reside in the \PROAUDIO\ subdirectory,  substitute
  the  correct path. GUS users would call their PLAYFILE utility  using  a
  similar  set up. I have found PLAYFILE great for playing all WAV  files,
  but  PLAY  will  handle  VOC files better. PLAYFILE  does  not  seem  to
  understand  stereo VOC files or the newer VOC format  supported  by  the
  most recent Soundblaster utilities.
  
  Here in an example for setting up VREC for the SB16:
  
    C:\SB16\VOCUTIL\VREC %F /S:%R /M:%M /Q /B:2
  
  This  setting  includes the full path name, the %F file  name  variable,
  the %R sample rate variable, the %M mode variable, VREC's switch for  no
  screen output and buffer size to 2K.
  
  If  you  are  using a soundcard that is not compatible or has difficulty
  using  external  players, you also have the option of  starting  BLASTER
  Master  with  the  "/I"  command line switch.  This  switch  causes  the
  initialization  and driver phase to be bypassed. You will  have  to  use
  external players exclusively if you choose this option.
CHANGING SCREEN COLORS ---------------
  BLASTER  Master's  graphic  screen  colors  can  be  changed  via  these
  function keys:
  [Default   colors  are  given  as  <color>  after  each   function   key
  description.]
  
     F1:      Background  <Cyan>
     F2:      Fileselect Playbox  <Red>
     F3:      Time Grid  <Brown>
     F4:      File Info text, Highlighted text, Vanishing Menu text<White>
     F5:      Field labels, backgrounds of Vanishing Menu & Dialog Box<Blue>
     F6:      Vanishing Menu Bar background, Pipe shading  <Bright Blue>
     F7:      Button Highlights, Pipe shading  <Bright Cyan>
     F8:      List Box Highlight, Fileselect Playbox text <Yellow>
     F9:      Wave Tip Highlight  <Bright Red>
    F10:      Wave Background  <Cyan>
CTRL-F2:      Wave  <Red>
   
  If  you  have  color VGA graphics, you can choose from 256  colors.  EGA
  users  can  choose from 64 separate colors. Keep in mind  that  the  way
  certain  colors  interact  with  each other  should  effect  your  color
  choices.  A  poor choice of screen colors (the poor interaction  between
  F4  and  F5,  for example) could result in unreadable dialog  boxes  and
  help screens.

SAVING SCREEN COLORS ---------------
  To  save  your current screen colors, select the Options Menu  available
  via  the  Vanishing  Menu,  which saves  the  colors  in  a  file  named
  BMASTER.CFG.  Return  to  the  Default  screen  colors  by  renaming  or
  deleting this file.
     

SETTING BLASTER MASTER DEFAULTS ---------------
  SB  Pro and SB16 card users can set certain recording parameter defaults
  by using the SET BMDEFS environment parameter.
  
            Input Source  Input Mode    Filter  Rate CDROM    F/X   FUNCTIONS
SET BMDEFS= {CD/MIC/LINE} {STEREO/MONO} {LO/HI} {NN} {ROMx:} {NOFM} {MORE}

  To  set  BLASTER  Master's default recording parameters to  stereo  line
  input with lo-pass filter and a sample rate of 22khz, use settings  like
  the one shown in this example:

                      SET BMDEFS= LINE STEREO LO 22

  The  order of the parameters does not matter. Use the SET command  alone
  at  the  DOS  prompt to check your environment. Users of the  Multimedia
  upgrade  CDROM may find a long pause on the Fileselect Dialog  Box  when
  an  Audio  CD is in the drive. Use the ROMx: parameter to skip verifying
  that drive.
  To  skip  CD ROM drive F:, use ROMF:. You may skip upto 2 CDROM  drives.
  Use  NOFM  to  turn  off the sound F/X. MORE will select  secondary  DSP
  functions.

SETTING THE BLASTER ENVIRONMENT ---------------
  Users  of  compatible  soundcards and 1.0 Sound Blasters  can  skip  the
  port/IRQ/DMA  scanning  by using the SET BLASTER environment  parameters
  supported by the 2.0 and Pro versions of the Sound Blaster.
     
     > Example:  SET BLASTER=A220 I7 D1
     (A  =  the  port address; I = the interrupt; and D = the  DMA
      channel.

  If  you have problems with BLASTER Master executing on your machine, try
  using this setting. It will also make the program boot up quicker!


REPORTING TROUBLE ---------------
  If  you find a bug in BLASTER Master, please report it in as much detail
  as  possible  so that I can fix it in the next version. I need  to  know
  which  specific  function you were using, where the VOC file  originated
  from  and  the  sample  rate. If the problem is hardware-related   (i.e.
  video  display, mouse functions), please include information  about  the
  system  you  are  using.  Support beyond that will only be  provided  to
  registered users.

COMMON PROBLEMS ---------------
  ERROR 5:
     This  is  a  DOS error meaning Illegal Function  Call,  which
      could   signify  just   about  anything.  The  most   common
      occurrence of this is when try to run BLASTER Master on a PC
      with   a  graphics  card  that  does  not  properly  support
      640x350x16  HI-RES EGA graphics mode. If you get this  error
      immediately  after  typing  BMASTER,  then  the  problem  is
      probably with your graphics card. The only fix in this  case
      is to change your graphics card.

  MOUSE CURSOR ERASE SYNDROME:
     I have recently heard of three or four instances of the mouse
      cursor seeming to erase the screen when it is moved. This is
      a  problem with your mouse driver. I only make calls to  the
      Mouse  API;  I  don't re-paint the screen.  Switching  mouse
      drivers has fixed this problem in every case so far.

PERFORMANCE TIPS ---------------
  BLASTER  Master  works  best on a very fast PC -- fast  processor,  fast
  graphics  and  fast hard drive. I use mostly floating  point  operations
  for accuracy. A Math Co-Processor speeds up most of the functions by  as
  much  as  40%. For example, mixing two 50K files requires over 1,000,000
  calculations.  A  slow  graphics card can  cause  wait  states  on  your
  processor.  That bargain-priced VGA system may not be such a bargain  if
  you  saved  a  mere  $50 yet slowed your PC down by 40-60%  in  graphics
  mode.  BLASTER Master is   based on using "virtual memory", i.e.,  using
  your  hard  drive wherever possible. While this is slower,  it  is  much
  more  reliable and supports a wider system base. It also easily supports
  HUGE  file  sizes. If you are lucky enough to have several megabytes  of
  RAM,  try  running  from a RAM Disk or at least use an extended/expanded
  memory  Disk  Cache.  It  makes a big difference  in  performance.  Disk
  fragmentation  can also lessen performance, regardless of what  software
  you are running.

USING BLASTER MASTER WITH OS/2 ---------------
  The following settings are required to run BLASTER Master from OS/2:
        full screen
        audio_adapter_sharing ON
        hw_timer ON
        int_during_IO ON

USING BLASTER MASTER WITH THE PRO AUDIO SPECTRUM -----------
----
  BLASTER Master works very well with the Soundblaster mode of the  PAS-16
  and  PAS+  soundcards by Media Vision. The Logitech Soundman  16  should
  also  work  just  the same as the PAS cards. You may  need  to  set  the
  BLASTER  environment to insure that you will be able  to  use  the  PLAY
  functions. The main point needed in the SET BLASTER environment  is  the
  card  type  parameter. Be sure to use "T0" (Tee Zero) as the card  type.
  See  more  about  this  under  the section  about  setting  the  BLASTER
  parameters. This is a minimal example of using the SET command  for  the
  PAS:
  
     SET BLASTER=A220 D1 I5 T0
     {where A=address, D=DMA channel, I=IRQ and T=card type zero}
     
     PAS  users  also have the option of calling PLAYFILE.EXE  and
      RECFILE.EXE during playback and recording. The advantage  to
      this is the PAS cards are only stereo in native mode, not in
      Sound  Blaster  emulation mode. Using  these  DOS  utilities
      should  sound  better and give you stereo VOC and  WAV  file
      support. See the section on Configuring External Players for
      detailed information on this.

  
SUGGESTED READING ---------------
  If  you  are  interested in learning more about how BLASTER  Master  works,   I
  suggest you read the following books:

> "Principles of Digital Audio" by Ken C. Pohlmann
  (Howard W. Sams & Co., 1985, 1989 second edition)
  An  excellent  introduction to everything from fundamental acoustic  theory  to
  the  way compact disks work. Some chapters are relatively easy to understand  &
  others are definitely NOT for the faint of heart.

> "Musical Applications of Microprocessors" by Hal Chamberlin
  (Hayden Books, 1985, 1987 second edition)
  Absolutely  the  best  edition ever published in the  field  of  digital  sound
  production  and  is universally considered a classic. This book  is  800  pages
  long  and  you  really must have an understanding of  advanced  mathematics  to
  read it.

> "Elements of Computer Music" by F. Richard Moore
  (Prentice-Hall, Inc. 1990)
  An   excellent   source  of  information  about  digital  sound   reproduction.
  Especially good for C programmers; examples are working C routines.

> "An Introduction to Digital Signal Processing" by John H. Karl
  (Academic Press, Inc. 1989)
  This  is  a  very  good  crash study course in DSP and assumes  the  reader  is
  familiar with higher mathmatics.

> "The Ultimate Sound Blaster Book" by Martin L. Moore
  (Que, 1993)
  A  shareware copy of BLASTER Master is included with this book along with other
  interesting programs. The information about FM music is particularly good.

> "The Sound Blaster Book" by Axel Stolz
  (Abacus, 1992)
  The  first  comprehensive book dedicated to the Sound Blaster. It  covers  DOS,
  Windows, MIDI, programming, and shareware.

> "Sound Effects Playhouse" by Kevin Weiner
  (Waite Group Press, 1993)
  This is a neat little book with some good explanations on digital audio and  FM
  basics.  It includes two 3.5" discs of programs, including a shareware copy  of
  BLASTER Master.
