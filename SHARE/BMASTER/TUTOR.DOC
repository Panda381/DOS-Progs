                       BLASTER Master
                         Tutorial

NOTE: The SAMPLE1.VOC example file is not included with the
      shareware version. Substitute any VOC file.

The future of sound recording is digital. Digital recording,
also  known  as  sampling,  uses  a  system  of  numbers  to
represent  the sounds recorded. Because the sound is  stored
as  numbers,  the  quality of the recording  never  changes.
Unlike  analog recordings like tape and vinyl  records  that
lose  fidelity  each time a copy is made or  the  record  is
played, a digital recording will always sound the same. With
the  release of the Sound Blaster, PC users can explore  the
world of digital recording.

Another big advantage of digital recording is that sounds
can be easily edited and manipulated mathematically. Usually
when a digital recording is made, there are segments at the
beginning and ending of the file that need to be trimmed
away. If you are recording speech, there will be "ugh"
sounds and long pauses that you will want to remove. Your
digital file will be smaller and sound more professional by
using these simple editing functions. This is where BLASTER
Master comes in.

BLASTER Master is a shareware program for editing sound
files. It is graphically based and has a very elegant and
intuitive user interface. But do not let the simplicity of
the user interface fool you. BLASTER Master is one of the
most powerful tools for manipulating digital files
available. All the basic editing functions are included.
Segments of the sound file can be removed, saved, moved,
copied and more. In addition to these basic block functions,
BLASTER Master also includes a tool kit of advanced digital
signal processes (DSP) for altering your sound files in ways
that are nothing short of amazing! With a little practice
and experimentation, you will be able to combine the many
functions in BLASTER Master to create sounds you never
dreamed were possible.

This  is a short tutorial on using BLASTER Master. We will
cover some basic editing and also have some fun too! Here is
a list of some of the features we will explore.

             * Echoing files with different delays and
          echo volumes to achieve a  variety of effects.
             * Reversing files to see what they sound
          like backwards.
             * Changing the pitch so your voice sounds
          like either a Munchkin or a giant.
             * Adjusting the volume of sound files
             * Fading the volume at the beginning and end
          for very  professional sounding results.
             * Mixing sound files together to make a
          combined file just like a multitrack recorder.
             * Looping segments of sound files for some
          really cool Rap DJ effects.
          
These are only a few of the processes we will explore. Don't
worry if you don't understand some of the features. By the
time this tutorial is completed, you will be well on your
way to becoming a Sound Blaster Master!


GETTING BLASTER MASTER UP AND RUNNING

     This  tutorial assumes that you have already correctly installed
     BLASTER Master.
     Here are a few tips for getting the most from the software:
     
     You  will need at least an 80286 based IBM PC compatible.  Sound
     processing  requires  alot  of computer  system  resources.  The
     faster  your computer runs and the faster your hard drive  reads
     and  writes the better. Since most of the DSP functions  require
     thousands, if not millions, of calculations, a math co-processor
     is very handy, but not required. 80486 DX processors have a math
     co-processor built in, so these CPUs naturally work quite  well.
     You  will  also  need  a high resolution  EGA  or  standard  VGA
     graphics  system  to run the software. BLASTER  Master  visually
     plots  the wave form to make editing easier and quicker. If  you
     want  to edit individual segments of the file for cut and  paste
     type operations, you will need a Microsoft compatible mouse. You
     will also need alot of free 640k memory. Since BLASTER Master is
     a  large  program capable of working with very  large  files,  I
     recommend a minium of 560k free memory. You might could  get  by
     with  slightly less, but some of the functions might not be able
     to  work  correctly. Most PCs sold today come with at least  two
     megabytes  of memory. We are only concerned with how  much  640k
     DOS  memory  is  free. That's what counts for running  programs.
     Last  but  certainly not least, I recommend you have  plenty  of
     free  space  on  your hard drive. Even though  the  unregistered
     shareware version of BLASTER Master will only process  files  no
     larger than 25 seconds in length, you can quickly use up several
     megabytes  of  disk space. A 25 second stereo  file  sampled  at
     22khz uses about 1.2 megabytes of disk space!


A WORD ABOUT SHAREWARE

     BLASTER  Master is a shareware program. In other  words,  it  is
     released  in a form that may be shared with others.  It  is  not
     public  domain. It is a copyrighted program and subject  to  the
     same  legal protection as all copyrighted works. BLASTER  Master
     can be found on BBS's and online services like GEnie, CompuServe
     and  America Online. Unlike most shareware, you are not  limited
     to  only 30 days of use. You may use the unregistered version of
     BLASTER Master for as long as you like. I hope you enjoy  it!  I
     do this because many of my BLASTER Master users are students and
     coming up with even a paltry sum of $29.95 is very hard. If  you
     are  able to pay for the software, then I would appreciate  your
     support.
     
     When  you  register BLASTER Master, I send you a code number  to
     remove  the 25 second editing limitation. This number  works  on
     all  versions  of BLASTER Master. Not only do you get  unlimited
     use  for  the  version you currently have, you  will  also  have
     unlimited use with the frequent updates of the software. As long
     as people continue to support BLASTER Master financially, I will
     continue to produce updates.

A QUICK TOUR THROUGH BLASTER MASTER

     We  are ready now to learn how to navigate through the functions
     and  dialog boxes of the program. As stated earlier, I  strongly
     recommend the use of a mouse. In most cases, you will only  need
     your  keyboard  for  entering  a  few  function  parameters  and
     entering  file names. If you should be using your keyboard,  you
     can  advance through the dialog boxes using the TAB key. The TAB
     key  combined with the SHIFT key moves in the reverse direction.
     You  will also find the arrow keys and the PgUp, PgDn, Home  and
     End to be very useful.

STARTING BLASTER MASTER

        
        From the DOS prompt, type:

        
          C:>BMASTER [ENTER]

     The  program will clear the screen and begin "looking" for  your
     Sound Blaster. If everything is as it should be, you will see  a
     light  blue  graphic screen with the BLASTER Master logo  and  a
     large dark blue dialog box titled, "Select Sound File". This  is
     the  opening  screen and where we will select  our  sound  files
     from.  The top of the File Select dialog box contains  an  input
     box for entering file names from the keyboard. "*.VOC" should be
     high-lighted within this input box. Just below the input box  is
     displayed
     the  current path. A large list box is displayed in  the  center
     and  to the left of the File Select dialog box. All of the files
     with  a  VOC  extension in the current path are displayed.  This
     list  box  is  used  to quickly and easily  select  sound  files
     without having to type them in. To the right of the list box  is
     another  list box that displays the disk drives on your  system.
     This  list  box  is  very handy for selecting other  drives  and
     subdirectories.   Both  disk  drives  and   subdirectories   are
     displayed  in  this list box. Selecting the ".." selection  will
     cause  the  current  path to fall back one directory  level.  In
     other words, if the path displays:
     
        
           C:\BLASTER\

     Choosing  the  ".."  will change the path display  to  the  root
     directory or:
        
           C:\

     At  the  bottom of the File Select Dialog box is a  row  of  six
     light  blue buttons. The functions of the buttons are  described
     below:
     
  PLAY
     Play  the selected sound file. You can choose this function from
     the keyboard by using ALT-P.
     
  RECORD
     Record  a new sound file. Choosing this function brings  up  the
     Record  dialog  box. We'll learn more about it  later.  You  can
     choose this option from the keyboard by using ALT-R.
     
  DELETE
     Delect  the  selected sound file. Because sound  files  take  up
     quite  a  bit  of  disk  space  and experimentation  is  usually
     required  to get the effect you want, I have included an  option
     to "clean up" un-needed sound files. Please be very careful when
     using  this option! You can choose this option from the keyboard
     by using ALT-D
     
  IMPORT
     Import  other sound file formats. Choosing this function  brings
     up  the Import dialog box. Windows 3.1 Wave files, raw SND files
     and Amiga IFF files can be loaded into BLASTER Master from here.
     We'll  learn  more about importing files later. You  can  choose
     this function from the keyboard by using ALT-I.
     
  ACCEPT
     Accept the selected sound file for editing. Mouse users can also
     "double  click"  the  left mouse button to  select  a  file  for
     editing  without  using this button. Keyboard users  can  choose
     this option by using ALT-A.
  QUIT
     Quit  BLASTER  Master  and return to DOS. You  can  choose  this
     option from the keyboard by using ALT-Q and [ENTER].
     
     Sound  Blaster  Pro  users  will  also  see  four  controls  for
     adjusting  the  onboard  mixer. The Master  volume,  VOC  player
     volume,  Microphone  and  Line In volumes  can  all  be  quickly
     adjusted  by  using  these sliders. These  controls  are  active
     during playback.


PLAYING A SOUND FILE

     Now  let's  select a file and play it back. The  file  list  box
     should  display the file EXAMPLE1.VOC. Using your  mouse,  place
     the  white  arrow  over EXAMPLE1.VOC and press  the  left  mouse
     button  only once. If you are using the keyboard, press the  TAB
     key  once to highlight EXAMPLE1.VOC and press [ENTER]. The  file
     name  input  box  should now display "EXAMPLE1.VOC"  instead  of
     "*.VOC". Using the mouse once again, place the white arrow  over
     the  PLAY  button and click the left mouse button once. Keyboard
     users  can press the ALT key and the P key at the same  time.  A
     red, shadowed box will appear with some useful information about
     the sound file during playback. This is the Playback Information
     box. It tells you the name of the file, how big it is, what  the
     sample rate is and the type of file. Playback can be stopped  by
     clicking the left mouse button or pressing the [ESC] key.  Sound
     Blaster  Pro  users  can also adjust the various  mixer  volumes
     during playback.

ENTERING THE WAVE EDITOR

     Now  that  we've heard the file, let's take a look at it!  Using
     your  mouse,  place the white arrow over the ACCEPT  button  and
     press the left button once. Keyboard users can press [ENTER]  or
     use  ALT-A.  The  File  Select dialog  box  and  the  logo  will
     disappear. A graphical representation of the sound file will  be
     drawn on the upper section of the screen. From this display,  we
     can  see  where segments of our sound files start and  end.  The
     width  of the screen represents the playback length of the file.
     The  height of the screen represents the amplitude or volume  of
     the  playback. This visual interface makes it very easy  to  see
     individual  segments  of sound files. The  vertical  grid  lines
     divide  the sound file into seconds or in the case of very  long
     files,   into   minutes.   With   very   little   practice   and
     experimentation, you will quickly begin to develop a "feel"  for
     editing sound files.
     
     Below  the  wave  form display is some very  useful  information
     about  the file we are currently editing. The name of the  file,
     length sample rate and playback time is always displayed. To the
     right  of this information are eight buttons. These buttons  are
     used to select DSP functions that will act upon the entire file.
     Placing  your mouse cursor over a button and pressing  the  LEFT
     mouse  button will select the function. Keyboard users  can  use
     the  TAB and Shift-TAB keys to highlight the desired option  and
     then  pressing  the ENTER key to select that function.  The  two
     farthest buttons to the right are very important. They  are  the
     NEW  and  MORE buttons. Selecting NEW will allow you  to  select
     another  sound file. Don't press it yet though! The MORE  button
     will  cause  the  function buttons to change.  Select  the  MORE
     button now. You should see seven more functions appear. The MORE
     button is still there to go back to the original functions.
  
Current Time Display
     Lets  move the mouse cursor across the wave form graph. You will
     notice  that  the  time  display across from  the  Playing  Time
     changes  as  we move the mouse cursor back and forth across  the
     wave  for graph. This feature displays the approximate  time  of
     the sound file at the point the mouse cursor is positioned over.
     I am sorry but keyboard users do not have an equivalent for this
     in the software.
     
Setting the Marker
     With the mouse cursor still in the wave form graphic area, press
     the RIGHT mouse button. Just below the mouse cursor position  on
     the  blue  bar a small white triangle will appear.  This  marker
     will come in very handy in the future. It can be used to mark  a
     reference  point  as a reminder. The INSERT and MIXER  functions
     can  also  use  the  marker  as  the  position  to  begin  their
     processes.
     
The Vanishing Menu
     When we move the mouse cursor to the upper most area of the wave
     form  graphic area, a pull-down type menu will appear.  It  will
     remain  visible as long as the mouse cursor is over  it  or  the
     SHIFT key is held. Moving the cursor away will cause the menu to
     vanish once again. Now you see it... now you don't!
     
     The Vanishing Menu contains four sub-menu options:
     
  FILE
     These  menu  options allow you to select a NEW  file,  SAVE  the
     current file, SAVE AS a new name or sound file format, IMPORT  a
     new  sound  file, RECORD a new sound  file and QUIT the  program
     and  return  to  DOS. The ABOUT option will  display  some  very
     useful information like the BLASTER Master version number,  your
     soundcards DSP version and the DMA, IRQ and PORT settings.
     
  OPTIONS
     These  menu options allow you to LOOP play the sound  file  over
     and over again, SAVE SCREEN COLORS and if you have made a change
     to  the  sound  file,  an UNDO or RETURN TO ORIGINAL  option  is
     available.
     
  TOOLS
     These  menu options correspond to the same DSP functions as  the
     lower  buttons.  There are some options not available  from  the
     buttons:  The PANNING function allows a stereo file to pan  from
     speaker to speaker. The SILENCE function allows silence bytes to
     be  inserted into the file to extend the playback time. The MAKE
     MONO  function converts a stereo file to a mono file.  The  HISS
     function  (Noise  Gate)  removes  all  bytes  below  a   certain
     amplitude.
     
  HELP
     This  menu option displays a simple online help screen. The  DSP
     functions  are  described in more detail than  just  the  button
     labels. This is a handy reminder from time to time if there  are
     features that you have not used very often.
     
Marking a Block
     Now  that  we  have had a look at functions for working  with  a
     whole  sound  file,  we are ready to see some  Block  functions.
     Processes that function with segments of the file, like cutting,
     saving and moving segments require that way to identify the area
     we  want to work with. This selection process requires a  mouse.
     Keyboard will not be able to select a block for processing.
     
     We  mark a block by placing the mouse cursor over the wave  form
     graph  at the point we want to start and pressing the LEFT mouse
     button.  A  blue line will appear at the point the mouse  cursor
     was  over  and the function buttons will disappear. If you  have
     selected an area you do not want, press the ESC key and the blue
     line  will disappear and the function buttons will pop up again.
     The  blue  lines can not be moved with the mouse.  Assuming  the
     first point is what we want, position the mouse cursor over  the
     wave  form graph where you would like the block to end and press
     the LEFT mouse button once again. Our block should be surrounded
     by  a  blue  box  and eight new buttons will  appear  where  the
     function buttons were before. Since we can not move the blue box
     lines,  it  is  always a very good idea to select slightly  more
     area  than we need. You can ZOOM into the block and continue  to
     mark  new  segments until you have exactly the block  you  need.
     Don't  worry if you don't like the new block, UNZOOM will return
     you  to  the previous segment. You can ZOOM up to 128  times  or
     until  the  sample  to  pixel resolution  is  1:1.  The  current
     resolution is displayed over the function buttons to  the  right
     of the screen. The size of the current block is displayed to the
     left of the File Size display. The playing time of the block  is
     similarly  displayed  across from the Playing  Time.  With  very
     little  practice, you will quickly learn to mark  a  block  with
     surgical precision.
     
  Block Functions
     As  mentioned  earlier,  the  DSP  function  buttons  have  been
     replaced with processes that act upon the selected block  rather
     than the whole sound file. Even the Vanishing Menu has different
     options  and  a different help screen now. The PLAY  button  now
     will  only play the block and the NEW function discards the blue
     box and returns to the original file.
     
  The CUT Function
     The  most common editing feature used in block mode is the  CUT.
     There is usually some unwanted sample data at the beginning  and
     end  of the sound file that needs to be removed. There may  also
     be  some  undesirable vocal components like  "ughs"  and  breath
     sounds that should be removed to have a more professional sound.
     We will cover all the functons later in the tutorial.
     
  Handy Tip
     When trimming the front and end of a new sound file, always  CUT
     the  left-most segment first. BLASTER Master uses a DOS function
     to  resize  an UNTITLED or edited sound file when the right-most
     segment  is removed. This is much faster than having to  make  a
     copy of the new file. You'll like it!
     
  The ZOOM/UNZOOM Functions
     The currently selected block can be displayed in more detail  by
     using the ZOOM function. Position the mouse cursor over the ZOOM
     button and press the LEFT mouse button. The wave form graph will
     change  to  display the block only. A new block can be  selected
     with  the mouse cursor and LEFT mouse button as before.  We  can
     continue  to  mark  and ZOOM until we reach a  sample  to  pixel
     resolution of 1:1. Selecting the UNZOOM function will  redisplay
     the  previously marked block in ZOOM mode until we return to the
     original block. Try the UNZOOM function now.
     
  Exiting the Wave Editor
     Now that we have seen how to mark a block, select the NEW button
     and press the LEFT mouse button (or press the ESC key). The blue
     box  will  disappear and the DSP function buttons will reappear.
     Select the NEW button again (or press the ESC key) and you  will
     be  returned to the File Selection Dialog Box. If a  change  was
     made  to  the sound file, a dialog box will appear to  SAVE  the
     changes.  We  will talk more about that in the next  section  of
     this tutorial.
  Handy Tip
     You  can quickly quit BLASTER Master and return to DOS from  the
     Wave Editor by pressing CTRL-Q!



Using the DSP Functions

     Now  that we have taken a quick tour through BLASTER Master, you
     should  be  familiar  with  the user  interface  and  navigating
     through the software. We will cover a few of the more common DSP
     functions  that operate on the entire sound file.  Some  of  the
     functions will require some parameters and other functions  will
     not.  The  functions  requiring user  supplied  parameters  will
     require  some  experimentation and  experience  to  achieve  the
     results you want.
     
The ECHO Function
     An  echo occurs when accoustic sound waves that have passed  our
     ears  are  reflected back from some surface that is off  in  the
     distance.  The distance of the reflecting surface and  how  well
     the  sound  is  reflected determines the kind of  echo  that  is
     produced. One of the more common DSP functions and also  one  of
     the more versatile functions is the ECHO. Everything from short,
     gated  reverbs to continuous canyon echos can be processed using
     this  single function. A bit of echo can help to sweeten a voice
     recording  and  produce a more professional  sound.  Three  user
     supplied parameters are required to process an echo:
  Time Delay
     The  time  delay  determines the point  in  which  the  echo  is
     returned. The range of this parameter helps determine whether  a
     reverb type effect is achieved or a long canyon type echo.  This
     parameter  ranges from 60 milliseconds to 400 milliseconds.  The
     majority of the echos desired will probably be in the 60 to  200
     millisecond  range. This parameter is the same  element  as  the
     distance of the reflective surface in an accoustic echo.
     
  Mixture
     The  mixture  is  how  loud the echos will  be  mixed  into  the
     original sound. This is a very important parameter for  how  the
     resulting echo will sound. Remember to not go overboard on  this
     setting.  A setting of 30% to 60% is usually all that is  needed
     to  achieve a very realistic result. This parameter is the  same
     element  as how well the distant surface reflects the  accoustic
     sound waves. The louder the accoustic echo is returned, the more
     reflective the distant surface is.
     
  Finite or Infinite Filtering
     This  parameter  determines how many  times  the  echo  will  be
     repeated. Finite means the echo will only be repeated once. This
     is  very  good for gated reverbs or when the sound file is  very
     complex. The Infinite filter causes the echo to repeat over  and
     over until it eventually fades away. This is a more natural echo
     but does not lend as well to reverb effects of short delay.
     
Echoing a Sound File
     We  will apply some echo to the SAMPLE1.VOC sound file now. From
     the  File  Select  dialog box, select the SAMPLE1.VOC  file.  As
     discussed earlier in the tutorial, you may select this  file  by
     using  the mouse or the keyboard. If you have correctly selected
     the  sound  file,  you  should now be in  the  Wave  Editor  and
     SAMPLE1.VOC  should be graphically displayed. Using  the  mouse,
     place  the cursor over the ECHO button and press the LEFT  mouse
     button.  Keyboard  users  can press ALT-E  to  select  the  ECHO
     function.  A ECHO function dialog box will appear in the  center
     of the wave form graph. We will need to add the delay and volume
     mixture parameters using the keyboard. The Delay field should be
     highlighted. We will use a delay of 150 milliseconds. Enter  the
     following number:
        
        150 [ENTER]
     
     The  Mixture  field should now be highlighted. We will  set  the
     volume  mixture to 45. This will give an echo that  is  not  too
     overwhelming. Enter the following number:
        
        45 [ENTER]
     
     The  OK  button  should  be highlighted now.  There  is  another
     parameter  that  we could choose to select at  this  time.  That
     parameter  is  the FINITE or INFINITE filter. The ECHO  function
     defaults  to the INFINITE option. If you wish, you can use  your
     mouse to toggle between the FINITE and INFINITE parameter to get
     a  feel for it. For the purposes of this experiment, select  the
     INFINITE option if it is not already selected. Using the  mouse,
     select the OK button. A graphical guage will pop up in the  wave
     form  graph  in the lower left corner. This guage is  used  with
     most functions to let us know how the function is progressing. A
     percentage completed will also be displayed to the right of  the
     guage.  Depending  on the speed of your PC, this  function  will
     take a few seconds.
     
     When  the  function is completed, the wave form  graph  will  be
     redisplayed and SAMPLE1.VOC will be replaced with UNTITLED. This
     tells us that the current file has been modified. BLASTER Master
     never changes the original file unless you choose to save on top
     of  it.  It is a very good idea to always rename the file unless
     disk space is getting low. Working with digital files gobbles up
     hard  disk space very quickly! BLASTER Master will warn you when
     your disk space is marginal.
     
     Select  the  PLAY function and we will hear what our sound  file
     sounds like with echo. You can select the PLAY function by using
     the  mouse or keyboard users can press ALT-P. You should hear  a
     very noticable echo in the sound file. By using different delay,
     mixture  and filter combinations you can achieve a wide  variety
     of  effects.  I  will leave it to you to experiment  with  these
     settings.
     
Saving the New Sound File
     Now that we have applied some echo to our sound file, we need to
     save  it and try some other functions. We could continue to  add
     more  DSP functions to the sound file. There is no limit to  how
     many  functions can be applied to a single sound file. Later  in
     the tutorial we will discuss combining functions to achieve some
     interesting effects.
     
     Using  the  mouse,  place the cursor over the NEW  function  and
     press  the  LEFT  mouse button. The Save File  dialog  box  will
     appear in the center of the wave form graph. The cursor will  be
     in  the  file name field of the dialog box. Using the  keyboard,
     enter:
        
        ECHO1
     
     We  could  save our file in another format besides VOC.  In  the
     lower right of the Save File dialog is a series of radio buttons
     to  select  the  desired format, such a WAV. This dialog  always
     defaults to the VOC file format. Just below the file name and to
     the left are three option buttons. These options can be used  to
     SAVE  the  file  as named, RETURN TO THE EDITOR  and  make  more
     changes  or DON'T SAVE and discard the sound file and  lose  the
     changes.  For purposes of our experiment, we want  to  SAVE  the
     sound  file. When you begin experimenting on your own, you  will
     often choose to not save the sound file to conserve disk space.
     
     BLASTER  Master will return you to the File Select  dialog  box.
     You should see ECHO1.VOC included with the other sound files.
     
     
The REVERSE Function
     Because  digital  files  are  nothing  more  than  a  series  of
     amplitude  values captured at a constant rate, the playback  can
     be easily reversed by simply reversing the order of the samples.
     In  other  words, the last sample byte becomes the first  sample
     byte and the first sample byte becomes the last sample byte. All
     the  subsequent  sample bytes are reversed in this  same  manner
     until  the  whole file has been processed. This is  one  of  the
     easiest  of  the  DSP functions to do. It is  also  one  of  the
     fastest. No user supplied parameters are required because of the
     simplicity  of  the process. Because of the simplicity  of  this
     function,  we  will not go over the steps for accessing  it.  We
     will   combine  the  REVERSE  function  with  ECHO  for  a  very
     interesting effect a bit later in this tutorial.
     
  Fun with the REVERSE Function
     There  is  not that much practical use for the REVERSE function,
     but you can have alot of fun with it. Television evangelists can
     spend hours and hours looking for those pesky satanic references
     in rock and roll lyrics. Many phrases will make new phrases when
     reversed  and auditioned with a bit of imagination. The reversed
     words  tend to be one or two syllable words but they  are  there
     none  the less. I have always poked fun at this but maybe  there
     is  something to it afterall... If you reverse Robert  Johnson's
     1935  song,  "Hellhound on My Trail" it seems  to  very  clearly
     state, "He's someone that I like!". Blues legend maintains  that
     Robert  Johnson  sold his soul to the devil to  be  the  world's
     greatest blues singer. Maybe they are right.
     Those  of  us who can remember that Paul McCartney  had  a  band
     before  Wings may remember that "Number Nine" from  The  Beatles
     White  Album  song  "Revolution Number Nine" played  in  reverse
     sounds  like "turn me on, deadman". It does indeed. The  British
     accent  helps  though. When I reverse my own Texas drawl  saying
     "Number Nine" it sounds more like "turn me own, dumb dumb".
     
     Did you know that Johnny Weissmuller's famous Tarzan yell sounds
     the same after being reversed? It does. Try it. Who ever created
     the  original effect spliced the tape onto itself in reverse  to
     extend  the call. Using the ZOOM feature will reveal the  actual
     point  the sounds connect. The warbled yodel in the Tarzan  yell
     is  produced by playing the original vocal at a faster speed and
     mixing  it  back  in  several times. That explains  why  neither
     Johnny  or Carol Burnet could ever reproduce it exactly. Someone
     put alot of work into it with tape and scissors!
     
     Another interesting experiment with the REVERSE function  is  to
     record your voice saying your name and then reverse it. Practice
     saying  your name in reverse until you can record it and reverse
     it  to produce your name forward again. Whereas this ability may
     not  help your resume' very much, it is fun for children of  all
     ages.
     
Combining the REVERSE and ECHO Functions
     This  experiment will combine the REVERSE and ECHO functions  to
     produce a very different type of echo than is found in the  real
     world. This is only one example of how functions can be combined
     to  produce some very interesting effects. You will soon be able
     to  use your imagination to achieve your own special effects.  I
     also recommend you begin to pay attension to the special effects
     in movies and on television. You will begin to recognize how the
     sound F/X experts make their magic.
     
  Select and REVERSE the Sound File
     Using the same steps to select a sound file as we did earlier in
     this  tutorial, select the SAMPLE1.VOC file and enter  the  wave
     editor.  First  we  will REVERSE the file.  Select  the  REVERSE
     button  using  the  mouse cursor and the LEFT  button.  A  small
     dialog box will appear in the center of the wave form graph with
     only  two options, OK and CANCEL. Choose the OK button  and  the
     sound  file will be quickly reversed. Once again the  file  name
     has  changed to UNTITLED. Select the PLAY option to audition the
     reversed sound file. Did it sound like you expected?
     
  ECHO the Reversed Sound File
     We  will  now select the ECHO function exactly as we did before,
     only this time the file is in reverse. Follow the same steps and
     parameters as before. For added effect, you can use a  delay  of
     200  milliseconds  if  you  wish.  Once  the  ECHO  function  is
     completed, the echoed sound file will be redisplayed in the wave
     form  graph.  Select the PLAY option again to  hear  the  multi-
     processed sound file.
     
  Reverse the Sound File Again!
     Once  more, select the REVERSE option and process the sound file
     for a third time. When the sound file is redisplayed, select the
     PLAY  option  to  hear  the  results  of  combining  these   two
     functions.  Instead of a natural echo, we have the effect  of  a
     "reverse  echo".  The sounds fade into the original  instead  of
     fading out. This can be very useful for outer space effects  and
     bizarre Doppler effects.
Saving the Multi-processed Sound File
     Using  the  mouse,  place the cursor over the NEW  function  and
     press  the  LEFT  mouse button. The Save File  dialog  box  will
     appear in the center of the wave form graph. The cursor will  be
     in  the  file name field of the dialog box. Using the  keyboard,
     enter:
        
        ECHO2
     
     As  mentioned earlier, we could save our file in another  format
     besides  VOC. In the lower right of the Save File  dialog  is  a
     series  of  radio buttons to select the desired format,  such  a
     WAV.  This  dialog always defaults to the VOC file format.  Just
     below  the  file name and to the left are three option  buttons.
     These  options can be used to SAVE the file as named, RETURN  TO
     THE  EDITOR and make more changes or DON'T SAVE and discard  the
     sound file and lose the changes. For purposes of our experiment,
     we  want to SAVE the sound file. When you begin experimenting on
     your  own, you will often choose to not save the sound  file  to
     conserve disk space.
     
     BLASTER  Master will return you to the File Select  dialog  box.
     You  should  see ECHO2.VOC included with the other sound  files.
     You  can use the PLAY option from the File Select dialog box  to
     compare the ECHO1.VOC and ECHO2.VOC if you wish.
     
Using the PITCH Function
     One  of  the  components of a digital sound file is  the  Sample
     Rate.  The sample rate is a steady, constant value that reflects
     how  many  samples are played during a single second.  A  sample
     rate  of  22khz (twenty-two kilohertz) means that 22,000 samples
     are played each second. When the original digital sound file was
     sampled (recorded), a measurement of the voltage passing through
     the  microphone was made 22,000 times a second. Playing back the
     file  at  the same sample rate will reproduce the digital  sound
     file  at the exact same pitch it was originally sampled.  If  we
     increase  or  decrease the original sample rate during  playback
     the pitch will change accordingly.
     
     The  PITCH function is accessed like the other DSP functions  in
     BLASTER  Master.  It  is not one of the default  functions  that
     appear  when a sound file is first displayed so it is  necessary
     to  use the MORE button. It is also included in the TOOLS  under
     the  Vanishing Menu, as are all the other functions.  The  PITCH
     dialog  box  uses a rangebar or slider to choose the  amount  of
     pitch change. The first time the pitch is changed the sound file
     will  be  redisplayed and the file name will change to UNTITLED.
     All  pitch  changes  to the UNTITLED sound  file  will  be  much
     faster.  Only  the  header will be changed to  reflect  the  new
     sample  rate.  Do not confuse the PITCH and the RATE  functions.
     They  are  very  different. We will discuss  the  RATE  function
     below.
  Handy Tip
     When  the  PITCH  function is used the playback  speed  is  also
     altered  along with the pitch. When lowering the pitch  you  may
     wish  to  combine  it  with the FAST function  to  increase  the
     playback  speed  without changing pitch.  This  is  particularly
     useful  with speech type sound files. The vocal inflection  will
     sound  more  natural. The same applies to increasing the  pitch.
     Use  the SLOW function to make the sound file less chattery. Try
     applying the REVERSE/ECHO/REVERSE technique along with  a  pitch
     reduction  and playback speed increase. This produces  an  erie,
     alien type voice that can be useful for games that you write.
     
Using the RATE Function
     Unlike  the PITCH function that merely changes the rate which  a
     sound  file  is played back, the RATE function actually  changes
     the  sample rate while maintaining the original pitch. The  RATE
     function   uses   a  mathematical  function  known   as   spline
     interpolation.  Interpolation can calculate missing  samples  in
     the  case of raising the sample rate or determine which  samples
     to  remove  or replace in the case of lowering the sample  rate.
     This  function  can be very useful for reducing the  size  of  a
     sound file without using compression (packing). Many sound files
     will sound no different when resampled to a lower rate.
     
  Aliasing
     If  after using the RATE function to lower the sample rate.  the
     sound  file  begins to get a tinny sound, then try  again  at  a
     slightly higher sample rate. The tinny sound is called aliasing.
     It  is  produced  when the sample rate is  not  high  enough  to
     capture  the higher frequencies accurately. The Nyquest  theorum
     states  that  a sound file must be sampled at twice  the  sample
     rate  of  the  highest  frequency. In other  words,  to  capture
     frequencies  up  to 11khz requires a sample  rate  of  at  least
     22khz. Many people falsely believe that a high sample rate  will
     insure a clear sample with very little hiss or background noise.
     The  sample rate is used purely to capture frequency range.  The
     signal  to noise ratio is determined by the number of bits  used
     in  each  sample. A 16bit file has a theoretic signal  to  noise
     ratio  of  96db.  An 8bit file can only have a signal  to  noise
     ratio of 48db.
     
Using the VOLUME Function
     Some  digital  sound files may not be sampled at a audio  volume
     that  suits your purposes. The VOLUME function is used to adjust
     the  amplitude  of  digital sound files.  Increasing  the  audio
     volume  of a sound file will not introduce any new noise to  the
     signal  but  it  will increase the volume of any noise  present.
     This is almost never a problem unless the original sound file is
     of a very poor quality. The VOLUME function is one of the easier
     DSP functions to do. It multiplies each sample byte evenly by  a
     factor that will increase or decrease the amplitude. It is  very
     usefull when combined with the MIXER functions.
     
     The   VOLUME  function  is  accessed  like  all  the  other  DSP
     functions.  It is also available as a block tool  and  is  often
     more  desirable for reducing noise than is the MUTE block  tool.
     Two  user  supplied  parameters are  required  to  perform  this
     function. First, we must tell the the function whether  we  will
     be  increasing or decreasing the volume. Enter either an "I"  to
     increase  or a "D" to decrease. Do not use the quotation  marks!
     Next  we  must supply the function with the factor in  which  to
     adjust  the  volume. In the case of decreasing the  volume,  the
     factor  must be between 99 and 1. This will lower the  amplitude
     to  that level relative to the original sound file. A sound file
     can  be  increased over a much wider range. The  volume  can  be
     doubled  by  entering a value of 100. This process  can  be  ran
     several times if some tweaking is required.
     
     The VOLUME function will recreate the sound file as UNTITLED and
     redisplay  the  processed  file like  the  other  functions.  Go
     through the same steps to save the file as before.
     
Using the FADE Function
     The  FADE  function  is  very similar to  the  VOLUME  function.
     Instead  of applying a constant factor that the samples will  be
     scaled  to, it uses an increasing or decreasing factor to  cause
     the  sound  file  volume to fade in or to fade out.  A  FADE  IN
     assumes you will be starting at the beginning of the sound file.
     You  can  FADE IN from the beginning to approximately  half  way
     into  the file. The FADE OUT function assumes that you  will  be
     fading out to the end of the sound file. You can begin the  FADE
     OUT  function approximately half way into the sound file to  the
     end.  This  is  an  extremely usefull DSP function  and  can  be
     applyed to almost any digital sound file.
     
  Determining the Fade time
     Usually the amount of time to fade can be determined visually by
     using the time grid that is displayed in the wave form graph.  A
     more specific method is to use the mouse cursor to determine the
     FADE  IN time by moving it over the wave form graph and noticing
     the  current time as it is displayed to the right of  the  total
     playing  time. Another method that can be applied  to  both  the
     FADE  IN  and  FADE OUT time window is to use the  mouse  cursor
     combined  with  the LEFT mouse button to mark  a  block  at  the
     beginning or ending of the sound file. The playback time for the
     block  is  displayed  to the right of the total  playback  time.
     After  noting the block time, use the NEW button to  exit  block
     mode and return to function mode. Be carefull to only press  the
     NEW  button  once. Otherwise you will be returned to the  Select
     Soundfile Dialog box. If you are working with an UNTITLED  sound
     file  and you accidentally press the NEW button twice, the  Save
     Soundfile Dialog box has a Return to Edit button that  will  put
     you back in function mode.
  
  Cross-fading
     The  FADE  function can also be used very effectively  with  the
     MIXER  function to apply cross-fading of two files. Cross-fading
     occurs when one sound file fades out as another sound file fades
     in.  Cross-fading  is very commonly used in broadcast  radio  to
     segue  one  song into another. Disk Jockeys use  a  mixer  board
     rather  than  digital signal processing. An  example  of  cross-
     fading using BLASTER Master would be to fade out about 4 seconds
     of  the  first  sound file and fade in 4 seconds of  the  second
     sound file. Using the MIXER function, mix the second sound  file
     into the last 4 seconds of the first sound file. Don't worry  if
     you  don't know how to use the MIXER function. That is our  next
     topic.
     
Using the MIXER Function
     The MIXER function is a very powerful tool in our arsenal of DSP
     functions. It literally combines two digital sound files into  a
     third combined sound file. The combined sound file can then have
     another sound file mixed in, and so forth. Each generation  will
     lose  some  clarity so there is a limit to how many sound  files
     can  be mixed in and still achieve decent fidelity. You can also
     choose  the exact point to mix a sound file in using  the  mouse
     cursor,  the  marker, a certain time into the sound  file  or  a
     certain  number of samples into the the sound file. One  primary
     thing  you  should be aware of is the mixer does not attempt  to
     adjust  the sample rate of the sound file being mixed in  if  it
     does  not  match the sound file selected for editing.  This  can
     work  to  your advantage for achieving certain effects. In  most
     cases  you will want to process one file or the other using  the
     RATE  function  if  the  two sound files have  different  sample
     rates.  The  amplitude or volume can be adjusted for  the  sound
     file  being  mixed  in. The basic use of the MIXER  function  is
     quite  simple  but getting the sound balance adjusted  correctly
     and selecting the point to begin the mix will take some practice
     and often several attempts to get it just right.
     
  Selecting the Mix File
     We  begin  our MIXER experiment by selecting the original  sound
     file  to be processed. Use the same steps as before to select  a
     sound file and display it in the Wave Form Graphic Display. When
     the MIXER function is selected using either the Function buttons
     or  from the Tools menu of the Vanishing Menu, the familiar File
     Select Dialog box will be displayed across the Wave Form Graphic
     Display. The heading of the dialog box will be SELECT SOUND FILE
     TO  MIX IN. This can be disorienting the first time the MIXER or
     INSERT  functions  are  selected. Both functions  use  the  File
     Select  Dialog box to choose the secondary sound file, so  don't
     be  confused. You are still in Function mode. Select the Mix  in
     sound  file using your mouse or the keyboard just like you would
     select  any other sound file for editing. (You could also RECORD
     a  new  sound  file  to  Mix in. We will not  go  into  that  at
     present.)  Remember!  The MIXER function  does  not  adjust  the
     sample  rate of the sound file being mixed in. If you  select  a
     sound  file  with a lower sample rate, the mixed in  sound  file
     will  playback at a faster rate. If a sound file with  a  higher
     sample rate than the original is chosen, the mixed in sound file
     will  playback  at  a slower rate. If the sample  rates  do  not
     match, you can always first process one of the sound files using
     the  RATE function as described earlier in this tutorial.  After
     selecting  the Mix in sound file, the Mix In Volume  dialog  box
     will be displayed.
     
  Choosing the Mix In File Volume
     The  Mix  in sound file can be added at a different volume  than
     the  original sound file. The Mix in Volume has a range of 1  to
     200. To use the original volume of the sound files, enter 100 as
     the volume. To lower the volume, enter a value less than 100. To
     boost  the volume, use a value that is greater than 100. If  you
     are  adding  background sounds to the original sound  file,  you
     will  probably want to use a lower volume than 100. If  you  are
     mixing in a sound file over a bed or background sound file, then
     you may wish to boost the Mix in sound file. In either case, you
     may  wish  to  experiment and apply the mixing more  than  once.
     Remember  to  use  a  different name  each  time  you  save  the
     processed  sound file. You will have to enter the Mix in  Volume
     value using the keyboard.
  Choosing the Mix In Point
     After entering the Mix in Volume, a dialog box will be displayed
     for  you  to  select how you want to select the point  to  begin
     mixing.  The  Mix  in  Point can be selected  using  your  MOUSE
     cursor, the MARKER, TIME into the original sound file or SAMPLES
     into the original sound file.
     
  Using the MOUSE Option
     Choosing  the  MOUSE option will cause the Function  buttons  to
     disappear and a graphical box will appear where the buttons were
     before. Move the mouse cursor over the Wave Form Graphic to  the
     point  you  wish  to begin the mix in and press the  LEFT  mouse
     button. If you wish to mix in from the beginning of the original
     sound file, move the mouse cursor as far to the left as it  will
     go before you press the LEFT mouse button.
  
  Using the MARKER Option
     Choosing the MARKER option will begin the mix in from the  point
     that  the  marker is set. If the MARKER is not set, the  process
     will  abort.  Using  the  MARKER is  a  very  handy  method  for
     preselecting the mix in point. Remember, the MARKER can  be  set
     by  pressing  the RIGHT mouse button with the mouse cursor  over
     the Wave Form Graph. The MARKER appears as a white triangle just
     below the Wave Form Graph.
     
  Using the TIME Option
     The  TIME option is a very accurate method of selecting the  mix
     in  point.  It offers selectability up to 1/1000th of a  second.
     The time value is entered using the keyboard.
     
  Using the SAMPLES Option
     The  SAMPLES option allows you to select the mix in point  at  a
     sample level. It is also a very accurate method of selecting the
     mix in point. Both the TIME and SAMPLES options will be used  in
     special cases. The MARKER and MOUSE options will usually be more
     than adequate for general use.
     
  Creating Special Effects with the MIXER Function
     The  MIXER function can be used to create many special  effects.
     Longer  echo  delays can be processed using the MIXER  function.
     You  can  not mix a sound file onto itself, but the  SAVE  AS...
     option  can  be quickly selected from the Vanishing Menu's  FILE
     menu to make a copy of the original sound file. Some interesting
     speech effects can be created by using several DSP functions  to
     generate  a very altered speech file. Then overlay the original,
     unprocessed speech file to add clarity back in. Like all the DSP
     functions  in  BLASTER  Master, you are  only  limited  by  your
     imagination.

Using the INSERT Function
     The  INSERT function uses the same basic user interface  as  the
     MIXER  function.  There is no VOLUME parameter required.  Unlike
     the  MIXER function, INSERT will adjust the sample rate  or  the
     insert sound file to match the original sound file. It will also
     adjust  the number of channels of the insert file to  match  the
     original  sound file. In other words, a mono sound file inserted
     into a stereo sound file will be coverted to a two channel sound
     file.  A  slight  delay  is added to the converted  channels  to
     simulate  stereo and add more depth. If a stereo sound  file  is
     inserted into a mono sound file, the two channels of the  stereo
     sound  file will be compared and mixed where needed. The  INSERT
     is a very fundimental DSP function. You will find yourself using
     it quite a bit.
Using the SLOW Function
     The   SLOW  function  is  a  tool  for  very  specialized   use.
     Essentially, it slows the playback speed of a digital sound file
     without  effecting  the  pitch.  The  playback  speed  will   be
     approximately half of the original, depending on the sound  file
     used. It requires no input parameters. The function itself is  a
     fairly   involved  process.  It  scans  through  the  file   and
     duplicates  very small segments of the waveform  to  extend  the
     time.  It  uses some inteligence to find the segments  and  then
     cross-fades the splice points. It works best with simple  speech
     tracks but can also be used effectively with more complex  sound
     files like music. Musicians will find it particularly useful for
     slowing down solos for closer study. Hardware devices to perform
     the  same  function,  such as the SloMo,  cost  several  hundred
     dollars and are limited to a few seconds. The SLOW function  can
     also  be  very  useful when used with the PITCH  function.  When
     increasing the PITCH, use the SLOW function to give the speech a
     more natural and less chattery sound.
     
Using the FAST Function
     We  could  not have a SLOW function without a FAST  function  as
     well. The FAST function is a simpler process and does allow  for
     user  selectable effect. Choosing the FAST function  displays  a
     dialog  box with a rangebar or slider for selecting how much  to
     speed  the playback. Like the SLOW function, it works best  with
     simple  speech type sound files but music can also be  processed
     effectively. The function works by removing minute  segments  of
     the  waveform  and  cross-fading  the  splice  point.  The  FAST
     function also works well when used in conjunction with the PITCH
     function. When using PITCH to lower the sound file pitch,  apply
     the  FAST  function  to give the resulting  sound  file  a  more
     natural  sound. Both the FAST and SLOW functions are interesting
     effects and worth some time experimenting with.
     
Using the VOCALS Function
     The VOCALS function requires a stereo sound file. It can be used
     to eliminate the vocals from music type sound files. The results
     will  vary from sound file to sound file. The process  works  by
     inverting one channel of a stereo sound file and mixing it  into
     the  remaining  channel  to produce a  mono  file.  All  of  the
     waveforms  that  are  in  the center of  the  stereo  space  are
     canceled out. Vocals are usually mixed in the center so they are
     usually  canceled out. Unfortunately the solos are also  usually
     mixed  in the center so they are also canceled out. As mentioned
     above,  the  results are determined on how the  original  stereo
     recording was mixed and balanced. You can sometimes improve  the
     results sometimes by tweaking the balance of the source channels
     during recording. The VOCALS function does work just as well  as
     the  $350 devices that are sold in magazines. There are no  user
     supplied  parameters required for this function. It is  alot  of
     fun and worth experimenting with.
     
Using the PANNING Function
     The  PANNING function also requires a stereo sound file. PANNING
     causes the volume to pan from one stereo channel to another. The
     user  may select a left channel to right channel pan or a  right
     channel to left channel pan. It is a very simple process can  be
     very  effective  and useful. The PANNING function  can  only  be
     accessed from the TOOLS menu of the Vanishing Menu.
     
Using the SILENCE Function
     The SILENCE function will insert silence bytes into a stereo  or
     mono  sound file. It is very usefull for extending the  playback
     time  for  syncing with a graphic file, such as an FLI file.  It
     can also be indespensible when mixing multiple files together.
     
Using the MAKE MONO Function
     The  MAKE  MONO function requires a stereo sound file.  It  will
     convert the stereo file to a mono sound file. This is very handy
     for reducing the size of a file by half or for users with a mono
     only soundcard.
     
Using the HISS Function
     The  HISS function can be more accurately described as  a  noise
     gate  filter.  There is a very popular utility  with  a  similar
     name.  I  had several requests from my registered users  to  add
     this  function, so I retained the name. It essentially  replaces
     sound bytes below a certain amplitude with silence bytes. It  is
     very  usefull  with  spoken  word  sound  files  to  remove  any
     background noise.
     
Using the PACK/UNPACK Functions
     The PACK/UNPACK functions only work on mono sound files. Packing
     involves  applying  a  real-time  compression  known  as   ADPCM
     (Adaptive  Delta Pulse Code Modulation). It is  not  a  lossless
     compression  and should only be used when absolutely  necessary.
     Depending  on  the amount of compression applied,  the  loss  in
     clarity will be quite apparent. An example of 2:1 compression is
     as follows:
     
     The   first  sample  byte  is  preserved  uncompressed  as   the
     "reference sample". The difference between that sample value and
     the  next  sample value is stored as a 4 bit value in  the  next
     byte.  Each  subsequent sample is then stored as the  difference
     between  the  last value as a 4 bit value. Each byte  after  the
     first  sample byte then contains the value of two sample  bytes.
     Because  waveforms  follow  a rising  and  falling  pattern,  an
     adaptive  difference is applied to help minimize the  amount  of
     clarity  loss.  This  adaptation  is  different  for  one  ADPCM
     algorythmn to another.
     
     The  UNPACK  function  will only work with a  previously  packed
     sound  file. It retunrs the sound file to an uncompressed format
     although  it can not restore the lost resolution of the original
     sound file. It is necessary to UNPACK a packed sound file before
     most of the DSP functions can be used.
     
     Compression works best with speech type sound files. Music  type
     sound  files will usually have the pitch and frequencies altered
     too  much for any practical applications. Once again, do not use
     compression unless absolutely necessary.
     
Using the SCOPE Function
     The SCOPE function is not actually a DSP function at all. It  is
     very  entertaining  and educational and was included  for  those
     purposes.  It can be very useful for adjusting the input  volume
     of  your input source. That is the reason it is included in  the
     RECORD  dialog functions. The SCOPE function can  be  exited  by
     pressing any key or clicking either mouse button. Just connect a
     microphone, select the SCOPE function and speak into  it.  Sound
     Blaster  Pro users will have the option of selecting  the  input
     source  (Microphone, Line In or CD Audio). The input source  can
     be  selected from the RECORD function. You  will get to see your
     voice  as well as hear it. Children particularly love the  SCOPE
     function.
     
     The SCOPE function uses the direct mode of sampling from the ADC
     (Analog  to  Digital Converter). The sample rate is set  at  the
     highest  number  of  cycles  your  processor  can  perform.  The
     smoothness  of  the  waveforms  are  achieved  using  two   page
     animation mode.

Using the BLOCK MODE Functions

     We have seen how processes can be performed on an entire digital
     sound  file. We have also combined several functions  to  create
     new and exciting special effects. Now it is time to explore some
     of  the  specific editing functions and block tools. There  will
     usually  be sections of the sound file at the beginning and  end
     that  need to be removed. There could also be noise or  unwanted
     vocal pauses like "ughs" that can be cut from the sound file.  A
     sound  file  may  contain a segment that needs to  be  moved  or
     copied  to  another portion of the file. We will  go  over  each
     editing function in detail in this section of the tutorial.
     
Entering BLOCK MODE

     BLOCK  MODE  can only be entered by using a mouse. There  is  no
     keyboard  equivalent to select a section of  a  sound  file.  To
     select  a  section  of a file, move the mouse  cursor  over  the
     waveform  graph  and press the left mouse button  once.  A  blue
     vertical  line will appear at the point where the  mouse  cursor
     was.  The  DSP Function buttons will disappear and you  will  be
     prompted to select the next section of the block. You can select
     from  either side of the first mark. Press the left mouse button
     once  again to select the next section of the block.  The  block
     selected  will  be  enclosed within a blue box.  The  Edit  Mode
     Function buttons will appear where the DSP Function buttons were
     before. The size in bytes of the block will be displayed next to
     the  file  size. The playing time of the block will be displayed
     next to the playing time of the full file.
     
  Important Tip!
     Always  select  more of the file for your first (primary)  block
     than  you want. Once a block is marked you can not use the mouse
     to  move  the blue lines, although you can select another  block
     within the original block after selecting the ZOOM function. The
     ZOOM  function will allow you to very accurately select  exactly
     the  section of the file you wish to modify. You can always  use
     the UNZOOM function to return back to your previous block if you
     want  to try again. With a very little bit of practice, you will
     soon be able to select exactly the block you need.
     
The BLOCK MODE Vanishing Menu
     The  Vanishing Menu options are different in BLOCK MODE.  It  is
     accessed the same way but the sub-menu options have changed:
     
  BLOCK
     These  menu  options allow you to select a NEW block,   CUT  the
     block  from the sound file, SAVE the block as a new sound  file,
     MOVE  the block to a new location in the sound file, make a COPY
     of  the block in a new location in the sound file or to PLAY the
     block.
     
  OPTIONS
     These  menu  options allow you to LOOP play the block  or  sound
     file  over  and over again and choose whether the PLAY  function
     will only play the selected block or the entire file.
     
  TOOLS
     These  menu options correspond to the same DSP functions as  the
     TOOLS  button that appears on the lower screen. We will  discuss
     them in detail later.
     
  HELP
     This menu option displays a simple online help screen. The BLOCK
     MODE functions are described in more detail than just the button
     labels. This is a handy reminder from time to time if there  are
     features that you have not used very often.
     
The BLOCK MODE Functions
  
  The PLAY Function
     The PLAY function in BLOCK MODE usually plays the selected block
     only.  This  is very useful for verifying that you have  exactly
     marked  the  section you want. You can play the entire  file  by
     choosing  the Options sub-menu from the Vanishing Menu  and  set
     playback to ALL.
     
  The TOOLS Function
     This  function displays a menu of DSP function tools  that  will
     modify  the selected block. Some of the tools are much the  same
     as  the DSP functions for modifying the complete file but others
     are  more  specific to a block of sound. These unique  functions
     can  always be applyed to the entire file by selecting  a  block
     large  enough  to contain the sound file. The BLOCK  MODE  tools
     are:
     
  LOOP
     This  function  will repeat the block in the soundfile  upto  10
     times. This function is very handy for making a sound stutter or
     to  create a pad for later mixing into another file. The  number
     of  loops can be selected using a sliding range bar with options
     from  2 to 10. This function will increase the size of the  file
     accordingly.
  MUTE
     This function will replace the selected block with silence. This
     can  be  very  useful  for  removing extraneous  sounds  without
     changing the playback time of the sound file.
  REVERSE
     This function will reverse the playback of the block.
  PITCH
     This  function  will raise or lower the pitch  of  the  selected
     block.  The  amount of pitch adjustment is based on a percentage
     of the original sample rate. The adjustment is selected by using
     a sliding range bar.
  ECHO
     This function will echo the selected block. The input parameters
     are  the same as the DSP Echo function for processing the  whole
     soundfile.
  VOLUME
     This  function will increase or decrease the playback volume  of
     the selected block. The input parameters are the same as the DSP
     Volume  function  for  processing  the  whole  soundfile.   This
     function  is often more desirable for removing background  noise
     than  the  MUTE  function. Whereas the  MUTE  function  is  dead
     silence,  the  VOLUME  function  can  be  used  to  reduce   the
     background sound and retain a certain amount of ambience.
  ACCELERATE
     This  function  will gradually increase the pitch  and  playback
     speed of the selected block.
  DECELERATE
     This  function  will gradually decrease the pitch  and  playback
     speed of the selected block.
     
  The CUT Function
     This  function  will remove the selected block  from  the  sound
     file.  It is very useful for removing unwanted sections  at  the
     beginning  and ending of a sound file. It can also  be  used  to
     remove  vocal  "ughs" and such and to shorten the  gaps  between
     words and sentences.
     
  Handy Tip
     The CUT funtion will use a DOS trick to shorten the length of  a
     file  when you are cutting the far right section of an  UNTITLED
     sound  file,  i.e., one that has already been  edited  at  least
     once.  The  block can not be ZOOMed to use this fast method.  If
     you want to remove sections from both the beginning and end of a
     sound file, remove the beginning section first! This will create
     an  UNTITLED  sound file and make cutting the end of  the  sound
     file much faster.
  
  The NEW Function
     This  function  will  allow  you  to  select  a  new  block  for
     modifying. The blue box will disappear and you will be  returned
     to the DSP functions for processing the whole sound file.
     
  The ZOOM Function
     This  function  will  display  the  selected  block  across  the
     Waveform  screen  graph. Once a block has been ZOOMed,  you  may
     select  another block until the display resolution reaches  1:1.
     BLASTER Master supports upto 64 ZOOM levels.
     
  The UNZOOM Function
     This  function will return the screen to the previous resolution
     before   the  last  ZOOM.  By  combining  the  ZOOM  and  UNZOOM
     functions, you can very accurately select exactly the section of
     the sound file to be modified.
     
  The SAVE Function
     This  function will save the selected block as a new sound file.
     The original sound file is left exactly as it was. You will then
     be  prompted to return to editing the original sound file or  to
     edit the new saved block.
     
  The MOVE Function
     This  function  will move the selected block to a  new  location
     within  the sound file. You can have alot of fun altering speech
     files and such by moving the words around to make new sentences.
     
  The COPY Function
     This  function  will copy the selected block to a  new  location
     within  the sound file. The original block is left intact.  This
     is  a very handy function for making RAP type sound files. NOTE:
     This  function is only available from the BLOCK sub-menu of  the
     Vanishing Menu.
     
Exiting BLOCK MODE
     Clicking the NEW button will exit BLOCK MODE and return  you  to
     the  DSP Functions. You also have the keyboard options of  using
     the  ESC  key  or  pressing ALT-N. This is also the  method  for
     selecting a NEW primary block for modifying.
     



Summary

     We  have now covered the functions and techniques needed to  get
     the  most  from BLASTER Master. With a little practice you  will
     develop the skill to manipulate your sound files like an expert.
     With  a  little  imagination,  the  possibilities  are  endless!
     Because  I  am constantly adding new features and improving  the
     interface,  BLASTER  Master will always  be  the  most  advanced
     digital editor available.
     
     Please  refer to the BMASTER.DOC file for a listing of BBSs  and
     online  services where you can find the latest update of BLASTER
     Master.  It  is also available on hundreds of other BBSs  around
     the  world.  I  appeciate any help you can  offer  by  uploading
     BLASTER Master to any BBSs you can!
     
     Thank you for using my software.
