program ExecDemo;

(*
  Demonstration program that shows how to use the Dos
  unit's Exec procedure to execute DOS commands (including
  running other programs or batch files).

  This program keeps prompting you for a DOS command until
  you enter a blank line.

  When using Exec, make sure you specify a {$M} directive
  so the heap leaves some memory available for the child
  process.
