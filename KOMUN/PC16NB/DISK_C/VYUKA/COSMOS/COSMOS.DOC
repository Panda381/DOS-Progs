            Introduction 
        
        COSMOS  is a program which provides astronomical simulations  the 
        same  way a planetarium does. COSMOS will show the past,  present 
        and future skies as viewed from Earth. It also shows the position 
        of  the  planets  and comets in orbit around the  Sun  and  gives 
        specific data about the celestial bodies.
        
        Program  options allow the user to select date/time  of  display, 
        direction  of  view, viewer's latitude and  longitude  on  Earth, 
        screen updating parameters and much more.
        Using  the display updating parameters COSMOS can display a  com-
        plete  day's movement of the heavens, or demonstrate  the  retro-
        grade motion of the planets. 
        
        COSMOS  was  written on a UNISYS IT with EGA/VGA graphics  and  a 
        80287. The program is intended to run on any DOS system that  has 
        VGA,  EGA, CGA or Hercules graphics.  Although the  program  will 
        run in CGA mode, the display quality is poor because of the  lack 
        of  resolution and colors. 
         
        The program will run with or without a math co-processor,  howev-
        er, it can be very slow without one because of the intense float-
        ing point arithmetic involved. 
        
        
        If  the  version number displayed on the first screen  ends  with 
        '(Limited),'  this  version of COSMOS is being distributed  as  a 
        Limited Demonstration version.  Its only limitations are that  it 
        will  work  for a limited date range and that it  includes  fewer 
        stars/objects  in the data base.  The Full Function version  will 
        work between the years 1700 and 2500.  The full function version
        also includes over 11,000 stars and messier objects.
        
        The  Full Function version can be requested by sending a  support 
        donation using the form at the end of this document.
        






            Horizon Display Description
        
        The  Horizon display attempts to show the sky as seen from  Earth 
        when looking in a specified direction at a specific time of  day.  
        The left side of the display is what would be seen over your left 
        shoulder as is the right side over your right shoulder.  The  top 
        of the display shows what you would see directly over your  head.  
        Because of the transformation from 3-dimensions to  2-dimensions, 
        the  distortion increases as  you approach the edges of the  arc. 
        Another way to think of what the display is representing is image 
        you  are  sitting in the middle of the planetarium.  You  see  in 
        front  of  you half of the dome.  The difference is that  at  the 
        planetarium  your field of view would not be large enough to  see 
        the  complete  half dome all at one time. With  the  program  the 
        complete half dome is compressed onto the flat screen.
        
        The  Moon  is drawn in its approximate phase with  the  New  Moon 
        represented   with an empty circle. The drawing of the  phase  of 
        the  Moon is rounded to the nearest quarter (New, First  Quarter, 
        Half, Third Quarter, Full, etc.).
        
        By  using menu selections you can control the brightness/size  of 
        the   stars/objects, direction of view, select Real Time  display 
        or a User Defined time, change the update rate of the display and 
        much more.  
        
        Note  that the time and date displayed at the top of  the  screen 
        represent  Local Time and assume that the system clock is set  to  
        daylight  savings time when applicable (see technical  notes  for 
        more details on daylight savings time).   When 'Leave Trails'  is 
        turned  on the time/date displayed on the left is the start  time 
        and the time/date on the right is the current time. 
        
        
                       CONTROL KEYS for this display are: 
        
                   p : Pause the updating of this display and put the
                      display in PICK mode (See Pick Mode)
        
               Escape: Exit Pause/Pick Mode.
        
               Enter : Pick Star (hile in Pick Mode). Any key press 
                       releases pick.
        
                   t : Toggles whether objects leave a trail as they move

                   l : Dump current screen to an IBM compatible printer
                       (Best results are obtained in EGA Mode)
        
               left/right arrows: scroll display view to the left/right.
                                   (changes view direction)






            Zenith Display Description
        
        The  Zenith display attempts to show the sky as seen  from  Earth  
        when  looking  directly over head at a given time of day  from  a 
        specified location on Earth.
          
        The top of the displayed circle represents the compass  direction 
        of North, the bottom of the screen is South, Right is to the West 
        and  the  left  side of the circle is toward  the  East  horizon.   
        Keep in mind that distortion increases as  you approach the edges 
        of the circle, especially for wide View Angles. 
        
        The Zenith View Angle specifies the lowest altitude an object may 
        be at and still be plotted on the display.  For example, if  Zero 
        is entered, then all object whose altitude is currently above the 
        horizon  will be plotted.  If 89 is entered, only  objects  whose 
        current altitude is greater than 89 degrees will be display. Thus 
        only objects within one degree of vertical to be displayed. 
        
        The  Moon  is drawn in its approximate phase with  the  New  Moon 
        represented   with an empty circle. The drawing of the  phase  of 
        the  Moon is rounded to the nearest quarter (New, First  Quarter, 
        Half, Third Quarter, Full, etc.).
        
        By  using menu selections you can control the brightness/size  of 
        the  stars, direction of view, select Real Time display or a User 
        defined  time,  change the update rate of the  display  and  much 
        more.  
        
        Note  that the time and date displayed at the top of  the  screen 
        represent  Local Time and assume that the system clock is set  to  
        daylight  savings time when applicable (see technical  notes  for 
        more details on daylight savings time).   When 'Leave Trails'  is 
        turned  on the time/date displayed on the left is the start  time 
        and the time/date on the right is the current time. 
        
        
                       CONTROL KEYS for this display are:

                      display in PICK mode (See Pick Mode)
        
              Escape : Exit Pause/Pick Mode.
        
               Enter : Pick Star while in Pick Mode. Any key press

            Sky Map  Display Description
        
        This  display is used to create a Sky Map located at given  Right 
        Ascension/  Declination  coordinates.   All  objects  within  the 
        boundaries  of the window are displayed.  This display is  useful 
        for  'zooming'  in  on a region of the sky the same  way  a  more 
        telescope  would be able to zoom in on a particular area  of  the 
        sky.  
        
        The  initial center and width of the display are determined  from 
        the values entered into the menu. The width is interpreted as the 
        amount  of  right  ascension covered from the left  side  of  the 
        window  to the right.  The amount of declination covered  in  the 
        display is calculated automatically to give the correct  scaling. 
        The  scaling factor also takes into account the aspect  ratio  of 
        the display device.
        
        While  viewing  the  sky map, the center of the  display  can  be 
        shifted  in Right Ascension using the left/ right arrow keys  and 
        can be shifted in Declination using the up/ down arrow keys.  The 
        window width can also be increased or decreased using the '-' and 
        '+' keys. 
        
        Note that star brightness/size is controlled as described for the 
        Horizon  and Zenith displays and the time/date are  displayed  as 
        described for the Horizon and Zenith displays.
        
        
                       CONTROL KEYS for this display are:
        
                Left / Right Arrows : Pan Display Window Left / Right
        
                Up / Down Arrows : Pan Display Window Up / Down

            Orbital (zenith) Display Description
        
        This attempts to show the position of the planets  and comets  as 
        they  orbit  the Sun.  The view is from above the  plane  of  the 
        solar  system  with planets moving counter clockwise  around  the 
        Sun.  
        
        By using the control keys you can zoom in toward the Sun or  back 
        away  from it.  The 't' key toggles whether the planets  leave  a 
        trail  as  they  move. The control keys will also  allow  you  to 
        freeze motion. 
        
        Note  that the time and date displayed at the top of  the  screen  
        represents  Local Time and assumes system clock is set  to   day-
        light savings time when applicable (see technical notes for  more 
        details on daylight savings time).  When 'Leave Trails' is turned 
        on the time/date displayed on the left is the start time and  the

            Orbital (ecliptic) Display Description
        
        The Ecliptic Orbital Display attempts to show the position of the 
        planets  and  comets as they orbit the Sun.  The  perspective  of 
        this view is the ecliptic plane of the solar system. It is viewed 
        edge-on  as seen from a position at the bottom of the  screen  on 
        the Orbital (zenith) Display. 
        
        By using the control keys you can zoom in toward the Sun or  back 
        away  from it.  The 't' key toggles whether the planets  leave  a 
        trail  as  they  move. The control keys will also  allow  you  to 
        freeze the motion of the planets. 
        
        As in all displays, the Escape key exits from the display. 
        
        Note  that the time and date displayed at the top of  the  screen

            Planet Size Display
        
        The  Size display allows the user to visualize the difference  in 
        size between any two planets, the Sun, Moon and other bodies.
        
        The  display  draws the two bodies to relative  scaled  size  and 
        labels  them  at  the bottom of the display. Above  each  of  the 
        bodies  is  their diameter in Miles.  The  figures  which  appear 
        between  the two bodies show the ratio of the size of the  larger 
        to the smaller one.
        
        Note: If the ratio of size is written in Red, then the size  dif-
        ference was beyond the resolution of the screen.
        
        Pressing the Esc key will exit the display.
        
        * Refer to Update Mode description of the Setup Time Menu.
        
        
        
            Planet Position Display
        
        This screen provides numerical information about the planets, Sun 
        and Moon's position as viewed from Earth.  
        
        The Right Ascension and Declination for each body are given along 
        with its Altitude and Azimuth.  
        
        Each  time  a key is pressed (excluding the Escape  key  and  the 
        'A' key) or the Left mouse button is pressed, the display time is 
        updated according to the Update Mode and the fields are  recalcu-
        lated and redisplayed.

            Planet Distance Display
        
        This screen provides numerical information about the distance  of 
        the planets from the Earth and Sun.
        
        It  displays the distance from the Earth to each of  the  Planets 
        and  the distance from each of the Planets to the Sun.  The  dis-
        tance is measured in Astronomical Units (AUs) and in Millions  of 
        miles.  
        
        AUs are equal to 149.6 Million Kilometers or 92.96 Million Miles.

            Planet Rise Times Display
        
        This screen provides numerical information about the rise and set 
        times of the planets, Moon and Sun.
        
        This display shows the rise and set time of each of the  planets, 
        the Sun and the Moon.  The Total Rise column gives the amount  of 
        time the body is above the horizon. 
        
        The  Phase and Apparent Magnitude of each of the bodies are  also 
        listed. 
        
        Each  time  a key is pressed (excluding the Escape  key  and  the 
        'A' key) or the Left mouse button is pressed, the display time is 
        updated according to the Update Mode and the fields are  recalcu-

            Pick Mode
        
        When in the HORIZON, ZENITH, SKY MAP or ORBITAL (zenith)  display 
        modes,  the user has the option of picking an object on the  dis-
        play  to  identify it.  The object to be identified  is  selected 
        using a graphics cursor.  If the cursor is positioned within  the 
        capture range of an object, and the Retrn key is pressed, it will 
        lock on to that object and display information about it.  If  the 
        cursor  is not within the capture range of an object,  the  Alti-
        tude/Azimuth  and  Right Ascension/Declination  of  the  location 
        selected is displayed.  
        






        
        During  Pick Mode, the user has the option of outlining the  con-
        stellations (Asterisms) by pressing the 'o' key.  These  outlines 
        can  be  left on during the 'Picking' process. To  turn  off  the 
        outlines simply press the 'o' key again.
        
        
             HOW TO USE THIS FEATURE:
        
        While in a display which supports Pick Mode, press the 'p' key to 
        enter  Pick  mode.  After all objects on the  display  have  been 
        updated to reflect the displayed time, Pick Mode will be entered. 
        Move  the  cursor around the screen by pressing the  arrow  keys.  
        For  finer cursor movement press the SHIFT or NUM LOCK key  along 
        with  an arrow key.  When the cursor is pointing at  the  desired 
        object,  press  the  Retrn key to select it.  If  the  cursor  is 
        within  the capture range of an object the cursor will  first  be 
        repositioned  to point at the object.  A pop up window will  then 
        appear which will provide details about the object.  Depending on 
        display  type  being  viewed, the following  information  may  be 
        included:
             
             ? Altitude and Azimuth (See Technical notes for definition).
        
             ? Right Ascension and Declination.
        
             ? Distance from Sun and Earth
        
             ? Phase of the object.
             
             ? Apparent Magnitude of the object.
        
             ? Constellation the object is part of.
        
             ? Meaning of Constellation name.
                  Ie. Orion, "THE HUNTER"
        
             ? Name of the object.
        
             ? Spectral Type of the object.
        
             ? Object Type (Planet,Comet,Star,Double Star,Nebula,etc.).
        
        A  Microsoft  Compatible  Mouse can also be used  in  pick  mode.  
        While viewing one of the dsplays that supports pick mode,  press-
        ing  the left mouse button will enter pick mode, just as the  'p' 
        key does.
        
        Once in pick mode, the mouse can be used to position the  pointer 
        the  same way that the arrow keys do.  When the pointer has  been 
        positioned  to the desired object, the left button of  the  mouse 
        can be used to select the object just as the Retrn key will.
        
        Pressing the right button of the mouse while in picked mode, with 
        nothing currently selected, will exit pick mode the same way  the 






        Escape key will. 
        
        Pressing  the center mouse button in pick mode will  toggle  con-
        stellation drawing just as the 'o' key does.
        
        Pressing the Left and Right mouse buttons together, while not  in 
        pick mode, will exit the display and return to the main menu.
        
        
            Find Mode
        
        Find  Mode will allow the user to select an object by name. If  a 
        matching name is found among the planets, comets, stars or  other 
        objects,  the matching object will be displayed.  Pick Mode  will 
        automatically  be entered with the cursor preset to point at  the 
        selected  object.   This  feature is available  on  the  Horizon, 
        Zenith and Sky Map displays.
        
        To  use this feature, select the Horizon, Zenith or Sky Map  dis-
        play  from the main menu.  A press of the 'f' key will display  a 
        pop-up  menu. The name of the object to be located is entered  at 
        the  cursor.  The entered name may contain letters,  numbers  and 
        wild-cards  (discussed next).  Pressing return accepts the  input 
        name and the search begins.  As ojects are being search,  matches 
        to the input name are display whenever found.  The user is  asked 
        whether  this is the object they were looking for.  If  not,  the 
        search  continues.  If the object found is correct,  the  display 
        boundaries  will be adjusted if necessary to display the  object.  
        At  this point, Pick Mode will automatically be entered  and  the 
        cursor  will appear pointing at the selected object.   Pick  mode 
        will work the same as previously described at this point. On  the 
        Sky  Map display, the display can always be adjusted  to  display 
        the  matched  object.  On the Horizon and Zenith  displays,   the 
        display  direction (or view angle) will only be adjusted  if  the 
        object is above the horizon.
        
        Wild-cards  are  the  '*' and the '?' characters.   They  can  be 
        placed  anywhere in the search string when the exact name is  not 
        known.   The '*' will match any amount of characters and the  '?' 
        will match any single character.  
        Say  we are looking for the star Betelgeuse in Orion  but  you're 
        not  quite  sure how to spell it.  Just enter bet*.   Any  object 
        with  its name starting with 'bet' followed by any other  charac-
        ters  will  be a match. Another example is,  you're  looking  for 
        messier  object M40-something.  Enter the search string  of  m4?. 
        This  will  match any three character string with the  first  two 
        characters being m4.
        
        
            Menu Screen Descriptions
             
        This  section describes the purpose and function of each  of  the 
        menu screens.  
        
        The overall layout consists of a main screen which has selections 






        for each different displays on the upper half.
        Along  the bottom of the menu are the sub-menu selections.   Each 
        of these allows the default parameters of COSMOS to be 'Tuned' to 
        fit your specific application.
        
        The Color of the COSMOS menu screens may be altered to suit  your 
        individual  taste.  The default screen color starts out  as  Blue 
        but  can be changed per execution by using the '-C' program  call 
        option (see program call options for more details).  
        The  default  of  Blue can also be changed.   Anytime  the  'Save 
        Setup'  selection  is  made, the screen color  currently  in  use 
        becomes  the  new default color.  Remember,  the  default  screen 
        color is used anytime the '-C' call option is not present.  
        
        
             Main Menu
        
               The main menu is basically made up of two parts. One 
               part  allows the user to select a display  to  view. 
               These  graphic and table displays are listed  below. 
               Refer  to  description of each display type  in  the 
               previous sections.  
        
               To select one of the following display types, simply 
               press the corresponding key to the display you  wish 
               to view.  Provided that all user entered  parameters 
               from  the  setup  menus are valid,  a  display  will 
               appear.  
        
               If  a  mouse is active, a block cursor  will  appear 
               within the Display Selection boundaries.   Position-
               ing the block cursor near the display to be selected 
               and  then press the left button. This will have  the 
               same effect and pressing the selection key itself.

               Setup Menus
        
               The  second part of the main menu is the Setup  Sub-
               menu selections.  These are found on the bottom  two 
               lines  of the main menu.  Using these  setup  menus, 
               COSMOS can be configured simulate different events.
               To  activate one of the setup menus, use the tab  or 
               arrow  keys  to cause the desired  sub-menu  box  to 
               blink.   Pressing  return will then cause a  pop  up 
               menu to appear where new parameters can be entered.
               If  a mouse is installed, pressing the right  button 
               will  simulate the TAB key being pressed.   Pressing 
               the left/right button combination will simulate  the 
               RETURN key being pressed.
        
               To change the values in a setup menu, begin by using 
               the  Tab key to position the cursor to the field  to 
               be changed. Enter the new value and press the Return 
               key.   The back space key may be used  during  value 
               entry.  When all fields are changed as desired,  the 
               Esc key is pressed to return to the Main Menu.  
               If a mouse is installed, the left and right  buttons 
               can be used instead of the Tab and Esc keys  respec-
               tively.
        
               If  a field in the setup menu was being entered  and 






               the Return key has not yet been pressed, the Esc key 
               will  treat the field as though the Return  key  had 
               been pressed before exiting back to the main menu.
        
               The  'Trails' and 'View Direction' setup  selections 
               do  not have sub-menus. Instead they  toggle/advance 
               the current value with each press of the Return key.
        
        
               Time Setup Menu
        
        
               This  menu is used to define the time for which  the 
               display  is drawn and to define how much  time  each 
               consecutive display is advanced.
               
               UPDATE  MODE- If System Clock (0) mode  is  selected 
               then  the system's clock is used to derive the  time 
               for each consecutive display and the value of Update 
               Rate  is ignored. The value of User Defined time  is 
               also ignored.
        
               Values  other than 'System Clock' use the  User  De-
               fined  Time  described  below.   Incrementing   each 
               consecutive  display  is done by adding  the  Update 
               Rate to the displayed time according to the  display 
               mode. 
        
               A  Sidereal Day is one revolution of the Earth  with 
               reference to the stars ( instead of the Sun). It  is 
               approximately equal to 23 hours and 56 minutes. 
        
               A  Lunar  Day is one revolution of  the  Earth  with 
               reference  to the Moon (instead of the Sun).  It  is 
               approximately equal to 1 day and 50 minutes.
        
               UPDATE  RATE defines how much time is added to  each 
               consecutive display. It is used whenever the 'System 
               Clock' Update Mode is NOT selected. See Update  Mode 
               definition. 
        
        
               MONTH, DAY, YEAR, HOUR, MIN, SEC are used to set the 
               User Defined Time. See Update Mode.
               *  NOTE  *:   User  defined  time  is  specified  in    
               Local  Time  including Daylight  Savings  Time  when    
               applicable. 
        
               Star Setup Menu
        
        
               This  menu  is used to configure how stars  will  be 
               displayed  when viewing the Horizon, Zenith and  Sky 
               Map displays.  Stars can be turned on or off and the 
               viewable magnitude limits can be adjusted.






        
               DISPLAY  STARS  selects  whether or  not  stars  are 
               displayed  on the Horizon, Zenith and Sky Map   dis-
               plays (Note: our Sun is not considered to be in  the 
               set of stars but is treated more like a planet) 
        
               ENLARGE STARS, If set, brighter stars will be  drawn 
               larger than dimmer stars and comets will be drawn as 
               a  cross.   Although this  selection  creates  stars 
               which  are not true to size, it may be  helpful  for 
               Non-EGA/VGA  monitors which can not  show  different 
               star intensities. It may also be useful for creating 
               more  readable printouts on the print  device.   The 
               CUTOFF  values used for determining intensities  are 
               the same values used to determine plotting size.
        
               FIRST  CUTOFF, Stars with magnitudes  between  minus 
               infinity  and  the First Cutoff are displayed  in  a 
               high intensity white or largest size.
        
               SECOND  CUTOFF,  stars with magnitudes  between  the 
               first cutoff and the second cutoff are displayed  in 
               a medium intensity white or a medium size.
        
               THIRD  CUTOFF,  stars with  magnitudes  between  the 
               second cutoff and the third cutoff are displayed  in 
               a low intensity white or a small size. 
        
               Stars  with magnitudes dimmer than the third  cutoff 
               are not displayed at all. 
        
               These  cutoff  values allow the user  to  limit  the 
               stars  displayed, to the stars that can actually  be 
               seen due to the amount of ambient city lights  where 
               they are located. 
        
        
        
               Planet Setup Menu
        
               This menu is used to select which bodies will appear 
               on  the displays and which bodies will be listed  in 
               the  tables. Select 'Yes' to enable the  display  of 
               each body and 'No' to disable it. 
        
               Yes,  Carl Sagan, I know, the Sun, Moon  and  Comets 
               are not really planets, but this is where you select 
               them. 
        
        
               Location Setup Menu
        
               This  menu allows the user to define where they  are 
               located  on the planet Earth.  This  information  is 
               not used in the Orbital or sky map Displays.  Nor is 






               it used on the Planet Distances display.
        
        
               LONGITUDE  is  the observer's  longitude  on  Earth.  
               This  value is used in the Horizon and  Zenith  Dis-
               plays and Positions Table. West of the Prime  Merid-
               ian is positive and East is negative. 
        
                  Example: Mpls, Mn. is approximately +90
                           Columbus, Ohio is approx.  +80
                  
        
               LATITUDE is the observer's latitude on Earth.  North 
               of the Equator is positive and South is negative. 
        
                  Example: Mpls, Mn. is approximately +45
                           Columbus, Ohio is approx.  +40
        
        
               TIME ZONE describes the difference between Greenwich 
               time and local time. 
        
                   Example : Central Time is a +6. 
                             Eastern Time is a +5.
                             New Zealand is in -12.
        
        
        
               Trails Setup Selection 
        
        
               LEAVE TRAIL selects whether the bodies on the graph-
               ical  displays  leave a trail behind  them  as  they 
               move.   This is useful for examining the paths  they 
               are following.
        
        
        
               View Direction Setup Selection 
        
        
               VIEW DIRECTION is used to select which direction you 
               are  looking when using the Horizon Display.  Direc-
               tion  is the same as it's measured using a  magnetic 
               compass.  The full 360 degree circle is broken  into 
               eight  directions;  North, North East,  East,  South 
               East, South, South West, West, and North West.
        
        
               Zenith View Angle Setup Menu 
        
        
               ZENITH  VIEW ANGLE defines the lowest Altitude  that 
               an  object can currently be at, and still appear  on 
               the  Zenith  display.  The smaller  the  value,  the 






               narrower  the imaginary cone of view above  you  will 
               be.  A value of zero provides a fish eye view of the 
               looking  up, including the whole horizon around  the 
               edge of the circle.
        
        
        
               Sky Map Window Setup Menu
        
        
               The  values entered here define the  location  about 
               which  the  Sky Map will be centered  and  how  much 
               Right  Ascension will be included between  the  left 
               and the right edges of the window.
        
        
               CENTER  (RA)  defines the value of  right  ascension 
               that the sky map display will begin at.
        
               CENTER  (DEC) defines the value of  the  declination 
               that the sky map display will begin at.
        
               WIDTH  (RA)  defines the amount of  right  ascension 
               that  will be displayed between the left  and  right 
               edge of the sky map display.
        
        
        
               Save Setup Selection 
        
        
               SAVE  MENU SETUP will save the current state of  the 
               menu selections and definitions. 
        
               NOTE:  The  saved menu configuration is read  in  at 
               program  startup. This will enable you to set  items 
               such as your longitude, latitude and time zone, then 
               have them come up as the default every time you  run 
               the program. 
        
               Example,  Go  through all the menus setting  up  the 
               parameters  the  way  they apply  to  your  specific 
               situation. Then select the Save Menu Setup option by 
               moving  the flashing-option cursor to the Save  Menu 
               Setup box followed by pressing the Retrn key.  A pop 
               up window will appear confirming the save.  From now 
               on  the menus will be setup this way every time  you 
               start the program. 
        
        
               Restore Setup Selection
        
        
               RESTORE MENU SETUP will reread the MENU.SAV file and 
               reload  the default menu setup parameters  that  the 






               program starts up with.
        
        
        
            Files used by COSMOS
        
        This  section  describes the files used by  COSMOS.  It  explains 
        their usage and where applicable, their format.
        
               STARFILE
        
               This  file  contains the star data used  by  COSMOS.  
               COSMOS will read as many of the stars from  STARFILE 
               as  will fit into the available memory on your  sys-
               tem.   The  chime tone will sound if the  number  of 
               stars  read in was limited due to lack of  available 
               memory.  This file is in binary format and  contains 
               the following information, which can be seen when an 
               object is PICKED in Pick Mode.
        
               ? Right Ascension of the object. 
        
               ? Declination of the object. 
        
               ? Magnitude (apparent) of the object.
        
               ? Which constellation the object belongs to.
        
               ? The name of the object.
        
               ? Spectral Type of the object.
        
               ? Object Type,
                  Ie. - Star, Double Star, Nebula, etc.

               MENU.SAV
        
               This  is the file used to save the current setup  of 
               the  menus. Refer to its definition under  the  Save 
               Setup section of the Setup-Menus description.
        
               Every time COSMOS is started, this file is read  (if 
               it  exists)  and  the menu  default  parameters  are 
               loaded  from it.  This file is also read to  Restore

               COSMOS Environment Variable
        
        
               If  there  is an environment variable  named  COSMOS 
               set,  the program will use its value as the path  to 
               access the files used by the program and you will no 
               longer  have to change to your COSMOS directory  for 
               the COSMOS program to find its files.
        
               As an example, add the line SET COSMOS=C:\COSMOS  to 
               the   autoexec.bat  file  (assuming  the   directory 
               c:\COSMOS  contains the COSMOS program and all  it's 
               related  files). Reboot your system. Now  change  to 
               any other directory, say the root directory. Execute 
               the COSMOS program (c:\COSMOS\COSMOS).  COSMOS  will 
               still be able to find its working files even  though 
               you are not in the COSMOS directory.
        
               GMT Time / Local Time /Daylight Savings Time
        
               COSMOS  thinks in terms of Greenwich Mean Time,  but 
               interfaces with the user in their Local Time. COSMOS   
               uses  the  value  you  set  in  TIME ZONE  (see  the 
               Location Menu) to make this correction.
        
               Your  system clock should always be set to the  cor-
               rect  local  time.  This includes  daylight  savings 
               time if applicable.  If daylight savings time is not 
               instituted where you are located or you do not  want 
               to set your system's clock in daylight saving  time, 
               COSMOS can be called with the 'n' option.  This will 
               instruct the program not to make any corrections for 
               daylight  savings time and will expect the clock  to 
               be set to Local Standard time.
        
               NOTE:  Daylight Savings Time is assumed to begin  on 
               the FIRST Sunday in April and end on the LAST Sunday 
               in  October  (U.S. DST). European DST  (see  the  'd' 
               program call option) is assumed to begin on the LAST 
               Sunday  in March and end on the LAST Sunday in  Sep-
               tember.   Australian DST (see the 'A'  program  call 
               option)  is assumed to begin on the last  Sunday  in 
               October and end on the First Sunday in March.
        
        
        






               Phase
        
               The phase of a body is defined as follows:
                (using the Moon phases as an example)
        
               0 or 360 degrees is the New Moon.
        
               270 degrees is the first half  (Waxing half).
        
               180 degrees is the full Moon.
        
               90 degrees is the last half  (Waning half). 
        
               This applies to all other solar system bodies.
        
        
        
               Altitude and Azimuth
        
               Altitude  and  Azimuth describe  the  elevation  and 
               compass direction an object is from the observer. 
        
               Altitude  is measured in degrees above the  horizon. 
               0.0  is  on the horizon and 90.0 is straight  up  at 
               zenith. A negative altitude implies that the  object 
               is below the horizon.
        
               Azimuth  is measured in degrees from North.  0.0  is 
               North,  90.0  is East, 180.0 is South and  270.0  is 
               West.
        
        
        
               AU Astronomical Units
        
               Astronomical Units are a measure of length which are 
               roughly  equal  to the radius of the  Earth's  orbit 
               around the Sun at its farthest point.  
        
               1 AU = 149.6 Million kilometers.
        
        
        
               Formulas used by the program
        
               The formulas used by this program were derived using 
               the  book 'Practical astronomy with your  calculator' 
               written  by Duffet Smith, Peter. Published by  Press 
               Syndicate of the University of Cambridge 1979, 1981. 
        
        
        
               Development System
        
               This  program was written using Turbo-C++ 1.01 on  a 






               Unisys IT with an EGA/VGA display and a 80287. 
        
        
        
               Program Accuracy
        
               The accuracy of the positions calculated and plotted 
               vary  by a couple of minutes of arc at  most.   This 
               will produce plots that are well within the needs of 
               an amateur astronomer. COSMOS, however,  should  not 
               be  used for the purpose of Interstellar  Navigation 
               (you may get lost).
        
        
               Astronomical Experiments
        
               These  are just some of the ways you can use  COSMOS 
               to watch the heavens move.  Many more are  possible, 
               it's up to your imagination.
        
        
               ? Watch a complete day go by in minutes.
        
               To  see the Sun, Moon and the planets  traverse  the 
               sky while you watch it a simple task.
               To see this motion set the Update Mode to "Increment 
               by minutes" and set the Update Rate to four or five.  
               Turn  off the stars to increase the  display  update 
               speed.  Look at the southern horizon and  watch  the 
               days go by.
        
        
               ? Watch the stars circle the North Star as the    
                  Earth rotates through a day.
        
               The  North  Star is approximately aligned  with  the 
               Earth's  axis  of rotation. If  you  photograph  the 
               northern  sky  with long exposures you  will  get  a 
               picture  with the stars forming  concentric  circles 
               around the North Star.
               To  create  this picture using COSMOS,  set  up  the 
               horizon  display  to view the northern  sky  from  a 
               northern  latitude. Turn  on  "Bodies Leave Trails." 
               Set  the Update Mode to "Increment Minutes" and  the 
               Update Rate to about 5.  As you watch each frame  of 
               the display progress the concentric circles appear.
        
        
               ? Watch the Sun's height in the sky at noon change 
                  through out the year. 
        
               As  the  Earth  travels around the  Sun,  the  angle 
               between  an  observer  on  the  Earth  and  the  Sun 
               changes.   On the Winter Solstice the Sun is low  in 
               the sky at noon and on the Summer Solstice it reach-






               es its high point.  
               To  see this you can use the program to display  the 
               position  of  the Sun every day at  noon.   Set  the 
               "Bodies Leave Trails" to YES. Set the Update Mode to 
               Increment  Day and set the Update Rate to one.  Turn 
               off  the display of stars.  Displaying the  southern 
               horizon  you  will see the Sun Rise  as  Summer  ap-
               proaches  and  then began to fall as Fall  leads  to 
               Winter.
        
        
               ? Watch the movement of the Sun during a Summer 
                  day above the Arctic Circle. 
        
               At  latitudes above the Arctic Circle the  Sun  will 
               not set on the longest day of the year, June 21.  To 
               recreate this 24 hour day, set the viewer's latitude 
               to  a value between 66.5 and 90.0. Set the  time  of 
               display  to  be  June 21 of any year.  This  can  be 
               accomplished by setting the Update Mode to Increment 
               Minutes and the Update Rate to about five.  Turn off 
               the  display of stars to increase the update  speed. 
               If  you watch the Suns movement during one full  day 
               you  will notice that the sun did not rise  and  set 
               but  rather that it followed a path of equal  height 
               around  the horizon.  If you display Planetary  Data 
               (from  the  main  menu) you  will  notice  that  the 
               Rise/Set time for the Sun is "Never Sets."
        
        
        
               ? Watch the retrograde motion of the planets.
                  
               The  retrograde motion of the planets refers to  the 
               way  they  wander through  the  constellations  from 
               night  to  night.  In fact, the  word  planet  means 
               wanderer.
               To  see this motion, set the Update Mode to  "Incre-
               ment Sidereal Day" and set the Update rate to two or 
               three.   This mode updates the display by  the  same 
               amount  of time it takes the stars to return to  the 
               same  position  in the sky each  consecutive  night.  
               Turning  off  the  display of the Moon  and  Sun  is 
               recommended for this experiment.  If you set "Bodies 
               Leave  Trails"  the planets will  draw  their  paths 
               through  the  stars  as they  move.   A  recommended 
               Date/Location setup for this display is; look at the 
               southern  horizon from North America at Midnight  on 
               September 1. With Stars displayed it can take up  to 
               fifteen  minutes (with math co-processor) to get  an 
               interesting display. 
        
        
        
               Caveats






        
               Since this program was written on an EGA/VGA system, 
               the displays were optimized to look best in EGA  and 
               VGA  modes.  Although the program does  run  in  CGA 
               mode,  the display is of lower quality (due  to  the 
               low resolution) and is limited in usefulness if  any 
               detail is required. 
        
               The program is very math intensive and needs a  math   
               co-processor  to  run  effectively,  especially   on 
               systems  with slow clock speeds.  The  program  will 
               run without math co-processor support. However,  the 
               program  becomes  limited in  its  display  updating   
               due to the long calculation times of the math emula-
               tion routines. 
        
        
               If  you have a math co-processor and are  interested 
               in seeing just how slow this program will run  with-
               out it, do the following.
               Before  executing COSMOS (at the DOS  prompt),  type 
               "set 87=n".  The program, when run, will detect this 
               value  and  use floating  point  emulation  routines 
               instead of the math chip.
               Now  that you have seen what a good investment  your 
               math  co-processor is, you can enable it by  exiting 
               COSMOS and typing "set 87=y." 
        
               NOTE:  The " (Quotes) were not supposed to be  typed 
               in.
