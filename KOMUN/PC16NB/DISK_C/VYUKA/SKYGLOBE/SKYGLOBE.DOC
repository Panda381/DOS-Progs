                      Quick  Starting  Instructions

         These instructions will enable you to get SkyGlobe up and
    running as quickly as possible. Then you can return to the
    manual to learn about some of SkyGlobe's advanced features.

         SKYGLOBE.EXE is the only file that is absolutely necessary
    in order to run SkyGlobe. If you wish to see more than 7000
    stars, you will need to ensure that the SKYEXTRA.DAT file is
    in the active directory as well.

         All you have to do to start the program is type SKYGLOBE and
    press Enter. SkyGlobe will determine your video adapter, but you can
    over-ride this choice with command-line switches, such as SKYGLOBE E
    to run in EGA mode. SkyGlobe will attempt to properly display SVGA
    images when called on to do so, but to run the sky display in SVGA
    you need to try SKYGLOBE S. If this doesn't work, try SKYGLOBE S2,
    or S3, up to 7.

         When you type SKYGLOBE and press Enter, you will be quickly pre-
    sented with a view of the southern sky for the current time and date.
    In the middle of the top of the screen will be a welcome and copyright
    message, which will disappear when you press your first command key.
    Most of the commands in SkyGlobe require only a single keypress or
    mouse click.

         Let's try a few of these commands. First press 'A' to start
    the automatic increment of time. The time, shown in the upper left
    corner of the screen, will begin to change by five minutes. Press
    'Shift-A' to reverse direction, then press 'A' again to stop the
    movement. Press 'B' for Brightness a few times and watch more stars
    appear. Most actions in SkyGlobe are reversed by using the Shift key
    or right mouse click. Press 'Shift-B', and watch the dimmest stars
    vanish. Try 'Z' and 'Shift-Z' to Zoom in and out.

         Want to set a specific time or date? Try 'M', 'H', 'D' and 'T'
    for Month, Hour, Day and Time (in minutes). Change the number of
    Constellation Lines displayed with 'C'. Use the cursor keys to
    change the Viewing Direction and Elevation. And if you ever need
    to use your computer for something besides SkyGlobe, press 'Q' to
    return to DOS.

         You can use the mouse for almost all program operation. Clicking
    on the first letter of a command in the Help menu is the same as
    pressing the letter on the keyboard. In general the left mouse clicks
    correspond to the normal key commands, and the right mouse clicks
    correspond to Shift key commands. (For simplicity, left clicks will
    be referred to as clicks, and right clicks will be noted as such.)

         I hope this quick introduction has gotten you well started with
    SkyGlobe. More detailed descriptions of the commands appear through-
    out the following pages. Have fun!
                                   -6-


                         Time and Date Commands

        SkyGlobe provides many ways to change the Time or Date of the
   displayed sky view. You can change the Time forward or backward by a
   minute or an hour. The Date can be changed forward or backward by a
   day, a month, a year, a century, or a millenium. Except for tiny
   changes which are corrected for by leap years, only the planets
   generally change from year to year. Over great time spans, preces-
   sion, the wobbling of the Earth's axis, becomes evident.


   Use the table below to help you remember:

                                Forward              Backward
   1   Minute             Press 'T'            Press 'Shift-T'
   1   Hour                     'H'                  'Shift-H'
   1   Day                      'D'                  'Shift-D'
   1   Month (30 days)          'M'                  'Shift-M'
   1   Year                     'Y'                  'Shift-Y'
   1   Century                  'J'                  'Shift-J'
   1   MilleniUm                'U'                  'Shift-U'



        One of SkyGlobe's most useful features is the Auto-Increment
   or Animation mode. This gives you the ability to simulate the pas-
   sage of time on your computer. To enter or exit this mode, press
   'A'. The sky view will begin to change in a manner that depends
   on the Auto-Increment parameters. Use 'Alt-A' to change the
   increment type from Time to Date and back. Use 'Shift-A' to
   change the direction of increment from Forward to Backward and
   back. You can also change the speed of increment. Press '>' to
   increase the speed, and '<' to slow back down. Only the active
   increment type, either Time or Date, is affected by the '>' and
   '<' keys.

        There are two ways to quickly activate some special Auto-
   Increment modes. Use 'R' to enter (or disable) Real-Time mode.
   This will synchronize the Time and Date to the system clock. You
   still have control over all commands except those related to Time
   and Date. Press 'Shift-R', and the Increment speed will be set to
   one Sidereal day, or about 1436 minutes. This has the effect of
   seeming to freeze the star and constellation display, while allow-
   ing the planets to continue their progress along the ecliptic. This
   is useful for learning about retrograde motion, as well as teaching
   something about the relative speeds of motions of the planets.

        If you would like to see what the sky will look like in the
   far future, or are more interested in the ancient past, the 'J',
   'Shift-J', 'U', and 'Shift-U' keys will Jump the Date by a century
   or change it by a milleniUm. This will give you the chance to learn
   about the wobbling of the Earth's axis called precession, which is
   described in greater detail later.
                                   -7-


                        Where  Are  We  Looking?

        Now let's learn about how SkyGlobe interprets directions. The
   program assumes you are standing outside and that your eyes are
   facing the same direction your feet are pointing. This is the View
   Direction. The display shows this direction in degrees, ranging from
   0 for due north, through 180 degrees for due south, to 350 degrees
   for 10 degrees west of north. The View Direction is also indicated
   by abbreviations in the parameter display, as well as along the
   Horizon line by initials.

        The View Elevation ranges from 0 degrees to 90. The Horizon ap-
   pears as a straight line at the 0 degree setting. It might help to
   imagine that you are extremely short for this one, so that the ground
   covers the lower half of your eyes, but is transparent. The 90 degree
   setting is like looking straight overhead at the Zenith.


                             Moving  Around

        SkyGlobe provides many convenient methods for rapidly changing
   the sky view. The up and down arrow keys change the View Elevation
   by 5 degrees. The right and left arrow keys work with the View
   Direction. When the View Elevation is near the Horizon these keys
   work about as you expect, but nearer to the Zenith they rotate the
   view more than they move it. This is correct when you remember that
   the View Direction stands for where your feet are pointing. PgUp and
   PgDn change Elevation in multiple jumps. Use Alt or Ctrl with the
   arrow keys to change the direction in smaller amounts. Finally, you
   can change the View Direction instantly to compass points by pressing
   'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W', or by clicking the mouse on these letters in
   the Help menu.


                           What  Do  We  See?

        Lots and lots of stars! You can change the number of stars
   displayed by pressing 'B' for Brightness to increase the number, or
   'Shift-B' to decrease it. The number of stars added or deleted from
   the display depends on the number currently displayed. After the
   number of stars currently displayed is an indication of the limiting
   magnitude this number represents. This is the magnitude of the dimmest
   star displayed.

        SkyGlobe allows you to adjust the magnification of your sky
   view. At a nominal magnification of 1, with the Inflated projection
   chosen, (this is the program default) half of the celestial sphere
   is visible. Since the eye can focus on far less area than this, a
   certain amount of distortion is evident at low magnifications. Still,
   you can use these views to quickly find areas of interest. The center
   of the screen is always the most accurate portion. Use 'Z' to increase
   the magnification and 'Shift-Z' or right mouse click in Help to decrease
   it. In common with many SkyGlobe commands, as described later, you can
   use 'Alt-Z' and 'Ctrl-Z' for smaller increments, and 'Home-Z' and
   'End-Z' to quickly maximize or minimize the Zoom index.
                                   -8-


                              The  Planets

        You can use SkyGlobe to learn something about the way the
   planets move around the Sun. The very word 'Planet' is derived from
   the Greek word for wanderer. The ancients, who spent more time out-
   of-doors than we do, noticed that a few bright 'stars' seemed to
   move against the 'fixed' background of the rest of the heavens.
   (Here I mean fixed with respect to each other; they were acquainted
   with the slow progression from one season to the next of the whole
   'sphere'.) They soon worked out the repetitive patterns the diff-
   erent 'stars' followed. We will learn how to simulate this motion
   shortly, but first we need to talk about some SkyGlobe features
   that are relevant.

        Although the stars don't really change much from one year to
   the next, the planets do. Notice the year displayed on the Date
   display in the upper left-hand corner. If this Time and Date are
   not displayed, press F2 to turn this display on. Use 'Y' or 'Sh-Y'
   to increase or decrease the year. You can use F3 to turn on the
   planet display, and to turn on planet labels. EGA/VGA color users
   see the planets in more or less appropriate colors. You may need
   to change the Time or Date to see your favorite planet.

        Now that we have seen the planets, let's see how they move.
   Change the Viewing Direction to South and the Time to 12:00 p.m. (noon)
   Turn off Daylight Time by pressing 'V'. Set Auto-Increment Type to
   Date by pressing 'Alt-A' if needed. Now press 'A' and watch the show.
   If you want to see how the planets stick near the ecliptic, make
   sure its display is turned on, (F6 does this).  Since your location
   may not fall exactly on the Standard Time meridian, the Sun may not
   be due South for you at Civil noon. Also notice how it wanders from
   side to side throughout the year, as the Earth speeds and slows down
   along its slightly elliptical orbit.

        Notice how Mercury and Venus stay close to the Sun. Mars has
   positively weird behavior, since it is outside the Earth's orbit, but
   relatively close by. It also has an eccentric orbit. The other outside
   planets drift more slowly against the background of the stars. You
   may see more clearly how the moon goes through its phases, being al-
   ways in New Moon phase when near the Sun. Move to Midnight, and the
   Moon will be in Full phase when it shows up in the South. Since the
   orbit of the Moon is inclined at about 5 degrees to the ecliptic, it
   wanders above and below it each month. This motion, which rotates
   through an 18 year cycle, accounts for the periodicity of eclipses.
   SkyGlobe 3.5 uses calculated planetary positions to allow for planet
   display without the need for data tables. For instance, take a look
   at the solar eclipse of July 11, 1991. Slowly step through the hours,
   and watch how the moon gradually overtakes the Sun.

        Another interesting way to watch the motion of the planets is with
   the Sidereal Time mode of the Auto-Increment/Animation feature. Find a
   direction and a time and date that contain some planets, and press
   'Shift-R'. The time will begin incrementing by 23 hours 56 minutes, or
   one sidereal day. The planets, especially the Sun, Moon, and inner
   planets, will begin to drift against the unmoving background of the stars.
                                   -9-


                                Precession

        One pattern that is difficult to explain with words and books, but
   which lends itself perfectly to the animation features of SkyGlobe, is
   the 25,800 year wobble of the Earth's axis called precession. We think
   of the North Star as constant and unchanging--there's even a Shakespeare
   quote to that effect!--but in fact it is a lucky accident for us that
   Polaris, a 2nd magnitude star, is so close to the north celestial pole.
   (SkyGlobe trivia: Polaris used to be the defining star of the magnitude
   scale until it was discovered to be slightly variable. It was set equal
   to magnitude 2.0 exactly, and all other brightnesses were compared to it
   using a logarithmic scale.) Our North Star will gradually come even
   closer than its current three-quarters of degree to the actual pole until
   about 2100, when it will start to draw away. Stargazers of the future
   will use stars such as Errai, Alderamin, Deneb, Delta Cygni, Vega,
   Thuban, and Kochab as their North Stars, as well as some lesser-known
   lights. Some of these are better fits than others. The pattern will
   then begin to repeat in about 27900AD, when Polaris will again be
   very close to the pole. The same sequence extends into the past.

        But enough of this exposition; a SkyGlobe view is worth a thousand
   words! First we need to find a view where the celestial north pole is
   easy to see. Press 'N' to instantly choose a viewing direction of North,
   and use the Zoom features and up or down arrows to select a view which
   comfortably displays the coming together of the RA-Dec lines at the pole.
   You could also try 'F' and use the menus to find Polaris. You may find
   it helpful to change your latitude with 'Alt-N' or 'Alt-S' to an even
   number, so the pole falls on top of a hash mark. One nice option is to
   change your location to the North Pole and look toward the Zenith.

        So far, so good, we can look at the north celestial pole. Big Deal,
   you say? Press the Space bar to enter Turbo mode, and then select 'U'
   to continually increment the Date by one milleniUm. (Note: you can select
   Turbo with the mouse but once in this mode you will need to make your
   selections on the keyboard.)  The algorithm that precesses the view gets
   a little slow for faraway dates and times, especially without a math
   coprocessor, so we want the biggest changes we can get. Polaris and the
   RA-Dec lines for the current epoch will start to spin off to the side,
   and the new North Stars will come in from the other side. If you start
   this with the mouse on top of the old pole it will help to show us the
   changes happening. The RA-Dec coords displayed will stay fairly near to
   90 degrees Declination, with some error creeping in, while Polaris gets
   further and further away. If you move the mouse cursor on top of Polaris
   again--you may want to turn off Turbo for this--you will notice it is no
   longer near the new celestial pole. You can also use 'J' to Jump by a
   century instead of a milleniUm, and use the Shift keys to go backwards.

        We are limited to about one cycle in each direction, mostly since
   it gets pretty slow going toward the endpoints. The planets are still
   displayed throughout this range, but I wouldn't plan a trip to them
   based on these coordinates. They are approximately correct for as far
   back and forward as I have data. I have followed the astronomical con-
   vention of using the Julian calendar backward indefinitely, even though
   no one was using our month names tens of thousands years ago.

             Finding  Planets, Constellations, DSOs, and Stars

        Let's say you wish to find a planet, or perhaps your favorite
   constellation. 'F' will access the Find menu.  You can use either
   the cursor keys or the mouse to navigate the menus.  Choose types
   of objects from the lower right menu, or use PgUp/PgDn or the mouse.
   A click or Enter at a chosen object will re-center the display at
   that object, if it is visible from your latitude.  If necessary,
   the time will be incremented until the object is above the horizon.
   The next time you use the menus, the last chosen object will be
   under the menu cursor.

        Rather than going through the menus, you can quickly identify
   many stars by placing the mouse cursor over them. If they are among
   the brightest 300 stars, their name will appear in the lower left-hand
   corner, if the mouse is on. If you press the left mouse button while
   on the object and it has a .PCX file, the image will be displayed on
   the screen.  If there is no .PCX file, or you aren't exactly on the
   object, (check lower left of screen), the screen will re-center to
   where the cursor is. To return to your previous RA-Dec setting, right
   click, making sure the cursor is in black sky, not on an object.

        I would like to say a few words here about nomenclature.
   Names of the constellations are well standardized. Many of the
   strange names in the southern sky are Latinized names of scientific
   implements, since these constellations were named (by the Western
   world, that is) in the beginning of the Industrial Age. Most of the
   northern constellation names go back much further. We use the genitive,
   or possessive, form of the constellation name to denote star names.
   For example, Alpha Centauri means the first star of Centaurus. The
   stars were generally enumerated in order of brightness. Since star
   brightnesses change with time, this correlation is not always exact.
   Many stars also have popular names, which are not standardized nearly
   as well as constellations.  You may want to take my lists with a grain
   of salt. Fifty-seven stars, four planets, the sun, and the moon, have
   been chosen for celestial navigation purposes by various authorities.
   Ctrl-N acts as a filter for this group. Labels for the navigation
   stars appear in a different color in EGA and VGA color modes.


                                Printing

        A snapshot of the screen may be printed with the use of the
   'P' command. You will be prompted to choose a printer type, and
   the output will be directed to either LPT1 or LPT2, depending on
   the setting chosen with Alt-F7. No matter your video type, a display
   will be created in VGA resolution for dot-matrix printing, or SVGA
   resolution for HP-compatible laser printing.
                                   -11-


                            Lines  And  Labels

        One of the most useful features of SkyGlobe is its ability to
   quickly and easily change the lines and labels that help our eyes
   and minds make sense of the vastness of the sky. This can be very
   helpful to someone just learning the stars.

        Use 'C' to increase the number of Constellation Lines displayed.
   As always, use Shift or right click to reduce the number of lines.
   The Constellation Lines have been grouped by importance, with some
   constellations having several classes of lines, such as the extra lines
   that change the Big Dipper into Ursa Major, the Great Bear. F10 instantly
   turns these lines on or off, which is a good way to learn the star
   patterns underneath the constellations. There are also several choices
   for labelling the constellations. Use F9 to roll through No labels-
   abbreviations-Small font full names-Large font full names-No labels again.

        The 1000 brightest stars can be labelled with numbers that repre-
   sent their brightness standing, and the three hundred brightest stars
   can be labelled with their names. Use F8 to roll through No Labels-
   Numbers-Small font names-Large font names-No Labels again. To change
   the number of stars to label, use F12, either on the keyboard or in
   the Help menu.

        The F5 command rolls through the Horizon Line, Zenith cross, and
   Hash-Mark displays, and the F6 command toggles the Ecliptic Line Display.
                                       
        Two levels of display are supported for RA-Dec grid lines,
   controlled with F7. These lines act somewhat like latitude and longitude
   lines on the globe of the Earth. Try looking due North in Auto mode with
   the lines on, and watch the celestial sphere rotate. This helps show how
   the Pole Star appears almost motionless.

        The Messier Objects--a list of 110 Deep Sky Objects compiled by
   Charles Messier--as well as 111 selected NGC objects, can be labelled with
   descriptive icons or the letter plus the appropriate number. The different
   types of objects are: open clusters, globular clusters, nebulas, spiral
   galaxies, and elliptical galaxies, which should be self-explanatory when
   you see them. F4 turns these objects on (icons only), gradually adding
   to the number each time it is pressed. To display labels for these objects,
   use Shift-F4.

        A beautiful representation of the Milky Way can be controlled with
   the 'K' key. This key will roll through: No display-Outlines only-Gray
   shaded regions-Blue shaded regions. You can adjust the brightness of the
   shaded regions (VGA and SVGA only) with 'Alt-K' for the inner region and
   'Ctrl-K' for the outer.

        You can place a frame around the rectangular screen display or
   the round SkyGlobe with 'O'. The choices roll through No Display-
   Rectangular frame-Round frame-Rectangular and Round frames-Off. Colors
   for these lines can be altered with 'Shift-O'. 'G' toggles Guidelines
   for constellation areas. Shift-G scrolls through line colors for these.
   
         Alt-O produces a field-of-view circle with a 1 degree radius (2
   degree diameter), to simulate a telescope eyepiece.
                                   -12-


                              Keeping Track

        SkyGlobe has two handy on-screen displays to help the user. The
   left-hand display will help you keep track of settings such as the Zoom
   Index, and will remind you of the Viewing Location. By pressing F2 you
   can see the Auto-Increment parameters, the Print parameters and other
   miscellaneous information. This display can be blanked by pressing F2
   yet again, or use Shift-F2 to peel off one screen at a time.

        A Help screen appears on the right-hand side of the screen. This
   display will remind you of the single-key commands of SkyGlobe. Press
   F1, and the function key assignments appear (on non-CGA machines). One
   more F1, and the list of alternate function keys shows up. Press F1
   again to turn off the Help display.  Once F1 appears on the screen you
   can use the mouse to bring up the rest of the options by clicking on F1.
   

                               Mousing Around

        SkyGlobe displays some handy information about the position of the
   mouse cursor. The RA-Dec coordinates of the mouse cursor, along with the
   name of any object underneath it, will be displayed in the lower left-
   hand corner of the screen. If the object is a star, its magnitude is
   displayed. The height and direction of the cursor, which are called
   the Altitude and Azimuth, are also displayed.

        You can run a great deal of the program using the mouse.  Clicking
   on the first letter of a command in the Help menu is like pressing the
   corresponding key. A left click chooses the command, a right click
   chooses the reverse of the command. In the case of L, it acts as Alt-L,
   choosing the location one step down the Location Menu without
   entering the menu itself. You can select the Turbo mode with the mouse,
   but, once in this mode, must make your selections on the keyboard.

        In the Location and Find menus, the mouse works as follows:
   You can use the mouse to navigate the menu, clicking on your choice
   of object or location. This will incorporate that choice into the
   settings, and, in the case of objects, centers them on the screen.
   Page types can be chosen in the lower right of the Find menu by
   clicking on the highlighted bar, or by using the cursor or PgUp/PgDn
   to select. A right click will return you to the program with the object
   centered and locked in place. This allows the object to stay centered
   while the other parameters are changed. Try this with the sun or moon
   and Auto-Increment/Animation, ('A'), set to hours. Remember, you can't
   see through Earth. To unlock this mode, press ESC.

        In general, left mouse clicks correspond to the Enter key in menus,
   and the right clicks correspond to the Shift-Enter commands.  In the
   Find Menu Alt-click will display an image of an object if the correct
   .PCX file is present, while Alt-Enter will perform the same function.
   See page 14 for more about images.
                                   -13-


                            Mousing continued

        On the screen the mouse can be used to manipulate the view and
   to display images. Clicking will center the screen wherever the
   cursor is located, unless it is on an object with a .PCX file, in
   which case an image of the object will be displayed. If you accident-
   ally click for image display, simply click again or hit any key to
   terminate the display process. If you wish to place a particular
   object near the center but aren't fussy about precise location,
   and don't want to take a chance on an unwanted image display,
   click near but not on the object.

        Right click will do one of two things, depending on whether the
   cursor is on an object or not. If it is on an object it will center
   and lock that object as it does from the Find menu. If it is not on
   an object it will act as an undo and return the cursor to the RA-Dec
   position it held before the last click that moved it.

        An alternative way to get an object's image to come up is to
   select the object from the Find menu with the mouse, which will
   center the object, and then click on the object again.  This makes
   it a two click process (one for centering, one for image display)
   easier than trying to move the cursor precisely onto some objects.

        You can control the mouse display with F11.


                            Enter/Shift Enter

        If you don't have a mouse or prefer to use the keyboard, the
   features controlled by right and left mouse clicks are generally
   mimiced Enter and Shift-Enter, respectively.  Within the Find menu,
   for instance, selecting an object with Enter will center it on the
   screen.  Selecting it with Shift-Enter will center and lock it, just
   as the right click does, allowing the object to remain centered
   while other parameters change.  Pressing ESC will unlock the object.

        Use Alt-Enter in the Find Menu to display a chosen image, if
   present.

        When not being used to select an object or location, and when
   not in the lock mode, Enter acts as a repeat for the most recent
   command. This can change a two key function, for example, Shift-Z,
   into a one key (Enter) command.  Shift-Enter acts as an undo for
   the most recent command.

                      Changing  Viewing  Locations

        One of the most popular pastimes for new astronomers is seeing
   what the sky looks like from other places. Perhaps you're thinking
   of moving, and want to make sure the stars will still be interesting
   to view from your prospective new home. (They will be!) Press 'L' to
   pull up a menu of locations from which to choose. Your current view
   will be left untouched at the bottom of the screen. Use the cursor
   keys or mouse to select a location.  Once you make your new choice
   you will return to the program with all your other parameters just
   the way you left them. Since SkyGlobe 3.5 has over 230 locations,
   there are two pages of locations to choose from. Use the 'End' key
   to quickly go to the spot that changes between pages.

        To choose locations from the supplied list, without actually going
   through the menu, you can use 'Home-L' (first location on menu, usually
   Caledonia MI), 'End-L' (Equator), 'Alt-L' or right click on L (one
   position down the list) or 'Ctrl-L (one up menu).  If you wish to move
   a small amount in a compass direction, try 'Alt-N', 'Alt-S', 'Alt-E' or
   'Alt-W'. Then you can change locations without ever taking your eyes off
   the current display. The east and west moves simply have the effect of
   changing the local observed time by 1 minute. The north-south changes
   are 1/4 degree, about 17 miles.


                         Displaying .PCX Images

        Perhaps the most exciting new feature in this version of SkyGlobe
   is its new facility to display SVGA .PCX images with a simple mouse
   click. It's really a lot of fun to click on Jupiter and be presented
   with a beautiful picture of our solar system's largest planet.

        Unfortunately, the size of such images precludes their inclusion
   in a tidy download package. Our motto here at KlassM SoftWare is:
   "Biggest bang for the byte!" Your evaluation copy of SkyGlobe is all
   set up to display properly named standard 256-color .PCX images, as
   long as you have VGA or better.

        All you need is to obtain your own images and name them properly.
   Planetary images should be named PLANET.PCX, where PLANET is a name such
   as JUPITER or SATURN. Messier Objects should be of the form M31.PCX, and
   the 100 hundred best NGC objects can be displayed as N7662.PCX, or some-
   thing similar.

        Note that it isn't strictly necessary for the image to reflect the
   object, the name is all that matters when you click.

        To display (or try to display) an image for an object, left-click
   while the mouse cursor is centered on the planet, Messier, or NGC.  If
   the file is there, you should see it. SkyGlobe does its level best to
   display the image in 640x480x256 color mode if it can identify your
   video card. The program has been tested with Tseng, ATI, and Video 7
   cards. The best way to ensure proper operation is to hunt up the disk
   that came with your system, and find the VESA driver. SkyGlobe will work
   in VESA mode if at all possible.
                                   -15-


                             Images continued

        If you can't get good results, you can start with SKYGLOBE V, which
   will force image display in 320x200x256 mode. I will continue to refine
   my SVGA handling in the months to come.

        So, where can you get nice pictures, and how can you make sure they
   are in the proper format? One way is to order the $10 2MB package when
   you register, but we won't restrict you to that! CompuServe has several
   forums, such as SPACE and ASTROFORUM, which have extensive libraries,
   and from which you are welcome to download for personal use. I only wish
   I was allowed to use some of those files to present to you! Anyhow, since
   most image files are in .GIF format, you will want a program such as VPIC
   to convert to .PCX. VPIC is a Shareware program which I highly recommend,
   and most of the files in my selection were converted with it. You can find
   the program anywhere you look for Shareware.

        Some of the files in my selection came from a highly respected
   graphics image guru named Bill Harris, who has hundreds of files, and
   who has uploaded many a megabyte to CompuServe and other boards. He is
   going to develop a SkyGlobe image list, and you can reach him at:

        Please use an SASE if you write for his catalog/file list.

        Remember, there are plenty of sources for wonderful pictures. NASA
   photographs are not copyrighted, so many catalogs and BBSs have a few.
   Even Windows Paintbrush can create .PCX files, so you can experience the
   thrill of clicking on Saturn and seeing your own rendition of the Rings
   appear. I'm sure I will learn more about good sources as this version of
   the program starts making the rounds.

        I plan to add support for .GIF and JPEG images before too long,
   which will help the storage requirements.

        You can also display images if you don't have a mouse, by using
   the Find menu. Press 'F' to enter the Find Menu, then use the PgDn,
   PgUp, and other assorted cursor keys to select the object of your desire.
   If you press Enter at this point, you will re-center the display on top
   of that object, as we have discussed before. If you press Shift-Enter,
   you will Lock the display on the chosen object, and it will stay locked
   until you press Esc. (This is kind of fun to watch with various animation
   modes.) To display the image, if one is present, press Alt-Enter.

        I'm excited to see how this feature of SkyGlobe 3.5 is received,
   and I hope you're excited to try it. Other than encouraging you to get
   your own images, to use your VESA driver, and to try a few extra modes
   if you have trouble, I can't think of anything else to say. SVGA is a
   bit of a black art, but the results are well worth it.

                          Special Command Modes

        The SPACE bar, Home and End keys, and Alt and Ctrl keys, have
   special meaning in SkyGlobe. These special command modes can be very
   useful in making the program even easier to use. Try them, you'll
   like them!

        The SPACE bar activates Turbo mode, which takes the next keypress
   and continually feeds it into the program, until the SPACE bar is pressed
   again. This feature is particularly useful with Zoom, direction, and Time
   and Date commands. Try it with 'J' or 'U' while facing North to see a
   great demonstration of precession.

        The Home and End keys, for many commands, take the next keypress,
   and either minimize or maximize the program parameter altered by that key.
   These are helpful for Zoom and Brightness, and are convenient ways to set
   the Time and Date to even numbers, such as midnight or Jan 1.

        The Alt and Ctrl keys often work as smaller positive and negative
   increments for the command with which they are used. Once again, Zoom
   and direction commands work well with these keys.

        Let's try an example that illustrates these features. First, press
   Home, followed by 'Z', to reset the Zoom Index to 1. You will have
   noticed that you were prompted to enter the command to be used with
   the Home feature. Now, press the SPACE bar. You will be prompted to
   enter the Turbo key. Let's use the Alt feature here. Hold down the Alt
   key, and press 'Z'. The display will slowly begin to expand, and a
   message on the bottom of the screen will remind you to press the SPACE
   bar when you wish to exit Turbo mode. Now try it for yourself! Turbo-
   Alt-arrow is a good choice, although you might want to try Ctrl-arrow
   if you have trouble with the Alt-key combinations.

        Using the Alt-key in conjunction with the function keys can be
   used to control some of the more obscure parameters in SkyGlobe 3.5.

   Alt-F1  reduces the display to stars and constellation lines only.
   Alt-F2  reduces the display to stars only.
   Alt-F3  gradually changes the background color from black to blue.
   Alt-F4  enables Twilight Mode, which artificially brightens the
           background when the Sun or Moon is above the horizon.
   Alt-F5  turns off the mouse position display, independently of the
           F2 Parameter Index. This makes mouse centering impossible.
   Alt-F6  toggles the Precession flag. With the current range of only
           200 years, this is not all that valuable, but it does work.
   Alt-F7  toggles the printer port between LPT1 and LPT2.
   Alt-F8  controls whether line feeds are added to carriage returns
           while printing.
   Alt-F10 controls the Aspect Ratio, useful for laptops and SVGAs.

        The TAB key is used for an interesting SkyGlobe feature. It will
   find the next sunrise or sunset, depending on the current situation.
   This feature occasionally stutters if used continually, but please
   don't tempt fate by using it too close to the poles, or the results
   may be a bit confusing.
                                   -17-


                         Changing Your Environment

        SkyGlobe 3.5 has the capability to customize many program settings.
   In VGA and SVGA color modes, you can brighten or dim the RA-Dec line and
   text colors with '+' and '-', and this bias can be saved in the .CF0 file
   (explained below). The text color can be changed with '/', and you can
   toggle between normal and reversed text with '.'. The Background color
   can be changed from black through several shades of blue with Alt-F3. You
   can select a twilight mode with Alt-F4. This will artificially brighten
   the background color when either the Sun or the Moon is visible. The type
   of Time display, either AM/PM or 24-hour, can be toggled with '='.

        Use of the number keys allows for the saving of current program
   settings. Up to 10 different settings may be saved, one of which will
   be used as the new program default. These keys will create the file
   SKYGLOBE.CF#, where # is a digit 0 through 9. When SkyGlobe is started,
   it looks for the .CF0 file to get its initial settings. If you would
   rather use the default settings, delete or REName this file. If you
   want to use one of the other files, just use SKYGLOBE #, such as
   SKYGLOBE 4 to use SKYGLOBE.CF4. This scheme allows for the use of
   batch files, such as ECLIPSE.BAT=SKYGLOBE 1, where SKYGLOBE.CF1 has
   been set up for July 11, 1991. These parameters can be mixed with video
   choices, as long as you separate the parameters with spaces. You can
   load these .CF# files from directly within the program with the Shifted
   number keys.  When you exit the program with either Q or ESC, the settings
   at that time will be saved in SKYGLOBE.CFU, which you can access either
   by typing SKYGLOBE U to start it up with the last exit settings. While in
   the program you can access these old settings at any time with Alt-U.
                                                                 
       If you are a registered user, the file SKYGLOBE.REG specifies up
   to three custom locations. (For unregistered users, you can use con-
   figuration files to use a nearby location as a default, without the
   need to go through the Location menu.) These custom locations will
   occupy the top three spots in the Location menu. When your order was
   filled, your Home Town was placed in the top spot, while Caledonia and
   Roscommon occupy the next two. If you move, or you wish to change the
   second and third cities, you may use any text editor to do so. But
   PLEASE BE CAREFUL! Before you make any changes, you should make a copy
   of the file. Then make certain you don't change the lengths of any
   field or the whole file. The location name, latitude, and longitude
   fields should be self-explanatory. The first three characters refer
   to North-South, West-East, and Daylight Time, respectively. Use 'N'
   or 'S', 'W' or 'E', and 'Y' or 'N' to specify the hemispheres, and
   whether Daylight Time is used. The next two characters refer to the
   time zone used. This number refers to the number of half-hours around
   from the Greenwich meridian the standard meridian for the time zone is.
   Use 10 for Eastern Time, 12 for Central, 14 for Mountain, and 16 for
   Pacific. European continental time is 46, not -2 or anything. You can
   also use this method to specify a location if you are traveling, such
   as an ocean voyage.

                           Memory Requirements

        This version of SkyGlobe will run perfectly with about 470K of free
   memory. Below that figure, compromises between the number of available
   stars and full-color vs monochrome have to be made. When in monochrome
   mode the memory requirements are greatly reduced.


                       Using SkyGlobe with Windows

        SkyGlobe will work just fine under Windows in full-screen mode.
   I have included a SKYGLOBE.ICO Windows icon. To install SkyGlobe and
   use this icon, follow this procedure: Choose which Group you would to
   install SkyGlobe in, and make it the active Group. Choose New from the
   File menu and click OK to add a Program Item. Use the Browse feature to
   find the directory which contains the SKYGLOBE.EXE file. To use the
   icon, select Properties, then Change Icon. You will have to type in
   the name SKYGLOBE.ICO, then click on OK.


                        The SkyGlobe Projection

        SkyGlobe 3.5 offers two projections for displaying the sky. The
   original SkyGlobe projection is a simple orthographic one. The newer
   projection, which is the program default, is a modified version of an
   orthographic view, which stretches (or Inflates) the display to preserve
   realistic shapes near the edges. Use 'I' to toggle between the two.

             SkyGlobe and the Stars - Some Background Information

        Why do we see different stars at different times? The Earth makes
   one complete rotation every day. If there were no Sun we could see that
   the stars appear to make one complete revolution at the same time. The
   North Star, Polaris (#51), is almost directly above the North Pole on
   the Earth's axis of rotation. So the stars near the North Star (about
   halfway up the northern sky in mid-northern latitudes) make tiny little
   circles every day. Farther away from the North Star the stars and the
   constellations they form wheel across the sky in huge arcs before they
   disappear below the horizon.


        Why do we see different stars at different dates? Imagine midnight
   in April. The Sun is behind the Earth, and you are facing away from it
   if you face due south. Now imagine midnight in October, six months later.
   You are still facing away from the Sun. But because the Earth has moved
   halfway around the Sun in its yearly orbit, you are looking in exactly
   the opposite direction to the one you were in April. So different stars
   are visible at midnight, and the ones near the North Star have made half
   a revolution. If there were no Sun, you could see that at noon the October
   sky is the same as the midnight sky in April.


        Before Standard Time Zones were instituted, the Sun was due south
   at noon everywhere. That was what noon meant. Now that is true only if
   you happen to live near the center of the time zone. If you live in
   Michigan, the Sun is due south around 12:30 or so. In New York City,
   which near the center line for the same time zone, the Sun reaches due
   south a few minutes before noon, over a half hour earlier than in
   Michigan. The Sun reaches due south somewhat later in Chicago than
   in Michigan, but because Chicago is in the Central time zone this
   occurs before 12:00PM. This has to be allowed for to make the display
   correct, and is unique to each location. Daylight Saving Time is handled
   in a similar manner, and is indicated on the Time Display by the letter
   D before the time if Daylight Time is in use.


        The sky can be viewed as a sphere with the Earth at the center, and
   the stars as fixed points on the sphere. Any attempt to represent this
   3-dimensional space on a 2-dimensional surface inevitably introduces
   some distortion. SkyGlobe uses a unique projection that can be calculated
   very rapidly and provides quite accurate rendering of shapes as they
   appear in the sky, even near the edge of the display. The old ortho-
   graphic projection used in earlier versions of SkyGlobe (and still
   available through the use of the 'I' command) had fairly severe dis-
   tortions near the edges, and was only slightly faster.

                           Background Continued

        Another issue that must be dealt with is double stars. Perhaps as
   many as half of all stars are actually multiple star systems. The naked
   eye frequently interprets two dim stars close together as one brighter
   star. Many 'stars' that serve as end-points on constellation lines fit
   into this category. If these stars were left dim and separate they would
   appear 'invisible' at low brightnesses and make constellation shapes
   unrecognizable. At higher brightnesses and low magnifications these stars
   would be plotted on top of one another as points, still artificially dim.
   The solution is to combine magnitudes for these stars. The ordering of
   stars in SkyGlobe reflects this combination, so at medium brightnesses
   and magnifications the display is as realistic as possible. The dimmer
   star is retained at its actual brightness, so at very high magnifications
   and brightnesses you will see one artificially bright star and one
   correct dim star.

        SkyGlobe contains coordinates for 7000 stars in the file
   SKYGLOBE.EXE. This represents all the stars visible to the naked eye.
   These coordinates were obtained from Sky Catalogue 2000.0 with permission
   from the publisher, Sky Publishing Corp. This permission is gratefully
   appreciated. The file SKYEXTRA.DAT contains another 18000 stars.

        Steve Coe of the Saguaro Astronomy Club in Arizona was kind enough
   to provide me with several lists of interesting Deep Sky Objects, one of
   which formed the basis for the recent addition of 111 NGC objects. Any
   mistakes in transcription, are, of course, entirely my responsibility.
   If you don't already know, the SAC has a fabulous database full of
   interesting information about a huge array of objects. If you are a
   Deep Sky Fan, or thinking of becoming one, you need to have a copy.

        The constellation boundary lines (Guidelines) were adapted from a
   NASA CD which sells for a ridiculously low price. You get more data than
   you could ever use for a pittance, all on a little disc. Their address is
   (or was):
                        NASA
                        National Space Science Data Center
                        Goddard Space Flight Center
                        Greenbelt  MD  20771


        SkyGlobe was programmed mostly in assembly language for maximum
   speed. Since there is necessarily a tradeoff between speed and accuracy,
   the precision of the star coordinates was carefully matched to the
   resolution of the graphics display and the projection algorithm chosen.

        Of course, no program is perfect. Any suggestions or bug reports
   would be greatly appreciated, and if you have any problems getting
   this version of SkyGlobe up and running on your system, don't hesitate
   to contact me. I can be reached at the address on the order form, on
   CompuServe at 76207,3377, or through the official SkyGlobe support BBS,
   the Wolverine BBS, (517) 631-3471 for 300-2400 baud, or (517) 631-3481

                          Questions and Answers


   Why won't SkyGlobe run in color on my system?

        There are two different answers to this question. Many people who
   have color CGA systems expect SkyGlobe to run in color on their systems.
   Unfortunately, the resolution of CGA color mode is only 320x200, which is
   insufficient to produce the high quality display necessary for SkyGlobe.

        Those of you with EGA or better displays may be equally dismayed
   if SkyGlobe comes up in monochrome mode on your system. This is due to
   a lack of available memory, and you should notice a message to that
   effect when SkyGlobe is started. (You can force monochrome mode with
   SKYGLOBE M.) One other possibility is that SkyGlobe may be using the
   value in your SKYGLOBE.REG file to start up in CGA mode, even though
   you now have a better display available. To change this, either change
   your SKYGLOBE.REG file, or start SkyGlobe with SKYGLOBE V.

   How can I speed up SkyGlobe?

        There are really several answers to this question. SkyGlobe always
   does what you ask it to do as fast as it can. (We think it's pretty
   fast!) The trick is to ask it to do things in a way that seems faster.

        The first method involves asking SkyGlobe to do less work. Try
   turning off everything you can do without, especially the Milky Way,
   planets, and horizon line. Other possibilities: ecliptic, right
   ascension and declination lines, extra constellation lines, and
   dim stars. In addition, determining the location of the mouse
   cursor can be a slow operation, so you may want to turn it off
   by using F11 or Alt-F5.

        The second method applies only to Auto-Increment mode. SkyGlobe
   starts off changing the view five minutes at a time. You can increase
   this rate by pressing '>'. Another way is to change the increment type
   to Date mode by pressing 'Alt-A'. Then increase the Date increment rate
   by pressing '>'.

        Finally, you can use several of the helpful keyboard shortcuts
   available in SkyGlobe to create just the view you desire. My personal
   favorite is Turbo mode, which is entered by pressing the SPACE bar.
   When you enter Turbo mode, the next key you press becomes the Turbo
   command. This means it will be continually fed into the program, just
   as if you were pressing it yourself. You can use this to zoom in with
   Z or Alt-Z, and you can sit back and watch it happen, instead of deciding
   how many Zs to hit. When you are satisfied, just press the SPACE bar again.
   Try this with Alt-arrow keys, or Ctrl-arrows, since not all keyboards are
   the same. It's also convenient for Turbo-H or Turbo-M, if you really want
   to get to a Time or Date in a hurry.
        The Home and End keys can save a lot of time as well. They generally
   go immediately to the minimum or maximum values of a command or feature.
   With Time or Date commands, this is the quickest way to go to midnight or
   noon, or the first or 15th of the month, or January or July. End-B is by
   far the quickest way to turn on all the stars. Home-Z is the quickest way
   to return to the minimum Zoom, and you can follow it with SPACE-Z to get
   to some moderate value.
                                   -22-

                              Q & A continued


        For changing direction quickly, you can't beat the N, S, E, and W
   direction commands. PgUp and PgDn can change the View Elevation faster
   than single arrow commands. Use the mouse button to quickly re-center the
   display at the position of the mouse cursor. And you can use Find to center
   the display at a particular object, instead of figuring out how to get
   there with the right combination of arrow keys.


   Why can't I get the new SkyGlobe to run from my hard drive?

        If you have both the old SKYGLOBE.COM and the new SKYGLOBE.EXE in
   the same sub-directory, you will not be able to run the new program. You
   either need to DELete SKYGLOBE.COM, or REName SKYGLOBE.COM SKY25.COM.


   Why does the screen go blank when I try to start SkyGlobe?

        If you attempt to start SkyGlobe in a video mode that is not
   supported by your system, the usual result is a blank screen, perhaps
   with the DOS prompt changing color. You will usually be able to get
   back to DOS by pressing 'Q'. If you are attempting to use SVGA, you
   may want to try SKYGLOBE S2, S3, S4, or S5 instead of SKYGLOBE S. The
   normal mode used for SVGA is the VESA standard, and you may need to
   load the VESA driver that came with your video card before starting
   SkyGlobe. The S2 is an older commonly used mode (6Ah), S3=Tseng chips,
   S4=Trident, S5=Paradise, S6=ATI, S7=Video 7, S8=Oak, and S9=the S3
   accelerator chip. The last two will only attempt the 800x600x16 mode
   to run SkyGlobe, and not the image mode. Not all of them have been
   tested. If you know you have SVGA capability, but none of these will
   work for you, please contact KlassM SoftWare for further assistance.
   Otherwise, try working your way up from CGA to EGA to VGA mode, to see
   if the program will work in one of these modes, with SKYGLOBE C, SKYGLOBE
   E, and SKYGLOBE V. For a Hercules monochrome system, try SKYGLOBE H.


   Why does the display jump sometimes?

         This is usually due to Daylight Time becoming active or inactive.
   SkyGlobe currently uses US average US dates for Daylight Time (Summer
   Time) in Northern Hemisphere locations, and common Australian dates for
   the Southern Hemisphere. Policies vary from year to year and place to
   place. Although it was Benjamin Franklin who first proposed Daylight
   Time, it wasn't widely used in the US until WWI in 1918. Therefore,
   even for locations that customarily use Daylight Time today, I normally
   deactivate it before that date. At any time, you can force Daylight Time
   with Shift-V. If it is active when you don't want it, press V to de-
   activate it.

         One other time the display jumps is during the changeover from
   the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. This took place at many different
   times in different countries, but SkyGlobe assumes that Oct 4, 1582, was
   followed by Oct 15, 1582.

                         Questions & Answers III


   Is there a version of SkyGlobe for the Macintosh?

        Since so much of SkyGlobe depends on assembly language programming,
   porting the program to the Macintosh would be a major undertaking. Now
   that V3.1 has some of the front end programmed in C, one small step for
   SkyGlobe has been taken in the portable code direction, but there are no
   immediate plans at the moment to work on a Macintosh version. There are
   still too many improvements to be made in the DOS world!


   Why does SkyGlobe always start with the same date, instead of today?

        You probably have a Configuration file setup for a particular time
   and date. Many people wish to save their own default settings for zoom,
   brightness, etc., but still wish to have SkyGlobe come up with the system
   time and date. To do this, press '0' to create a new default configuration,
   but make sure to press '1' when asked whether to use current or system
   time. If you wish to save a setup for an eclipse or a birthday, use 1-9
   as the Configuration file number, press '0' to use Current as the time,
   and use SKYGLOBE 1 (or whatever) to start up with the appropriate settings.


   What about Caps Lock?

        SkyGlobe attempts to ignore Caps Lock, so the Shift Commands will
   operate properly. If for some reason you find some commands behaving
   backwards, perhaps SkyGlobe is having trouble identifying the Caps Lock
   state, so you may want to turn it off.


   Why does the time change sometimes when I Find an object?

        If the desired object is not currently above the horizon, but it will
   be sometime during the next 24 hours, the time will be incremented until
   the object just clears the horizon. It is possible that you are more
   interested in the date that an object will appear over the horizon for
   a given time. You might be able to use Sidereal Time mode to your advan-
   tage here, but there is currently no way to select for date instead of
   time, or to defeat the time increment feature.


   Why won't SkyGlobe print properly on my system?

        When you press 'P', you will be prompted to choose between 9-pin dot
   matrix, 24-pin dot matrix, and laser printers. The printout will be
   directed to the printer port you have chosen, LPT1 if you didn't change
   it, and will insert line feeds for the dot matrix printers. You can change
   the port with Alt-F7, and the line feed state with Alt-F8. The aspect
   ratio of the printout should be correct, but the current printout may
   not quite fill the page. Printing will continue to be improved in future
   releases of SkyGlobe.

                         DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE

Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue
using it, you are expected to register. Individual programs
differ on details -- some request registration while others
require it, some specify a maximum trial period. With
registration, you get anything from the simple right to continue
using the software to an updated program with printed manual.

Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software,
and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors are accomplished
programmers, just like commercial authors, and the programs are
of comparable quality. (In both cases, there are good programs
and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of
distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy
and distribute the software, either to all and sundry or to a
specific group. For example, some authors require written
permission before a commercial disk vendor may copy their
Shareware.

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You
should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook,
whether it's commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system makes
fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you buy.
And because the overhead is low, prices are low also. Shareware
has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
product, you don't pay for it.



                             Support Policy

We at KlassM SoftWare are totally committed to offering the most
bang for the byte in astronomy software. We are proud of SkyGlobe,
and we want to make sure it works for you. If you have any problems,
please contact us at the address on the order form, or leave me a
note on CompuServe at 76207,3377. Since registered users have had
the opportunity to try SkyGlobe before they pay for it, we shouldn't
have too many problems. If some version change has made it impossible
to run SkyGlobe on your system, I will either do what I can to make
it work for you, or refund your money.

We are proud to announce a new official support BBS for SkyGlobe.
Here is another way you can ask questions or make comments.  The
board is The Wolverine BBS, Sysop Rick Rosinski, (517) 631-3471
for 300-2400 baud, or (517) 631-3481 for HST/v.32/v.32bis. Use
the SKYGLOBE conference, or leave me EMail.

                          DISCLAIMER - AGREEMENT

Users of SkyGlobe 3.5 must accept this disclaimer of warranty: "SkyGlobe
3.5 is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all warranties, expressed or
implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability
and of fitness for any purpose. The author assumes no liability for damages,
direct or consequential, which may result from the use of SkyGlobe 3.5."

SkyGlobe 3.5 is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge to the
user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your friends, but please
do not give it away altered or as part of another system.  The essence of
"user-supported" software is to provide personal computer users with quality
software without high prices, and yet to provide incentive for programmers
to continue to develop new products.  If you find this program useful and
find that you are using SkyGlobe 3.5 and continue to use SkyGlobe 3.5 after
a reasonable trial period, you must make a registration payment of $20 to
KlassM SoftWare.  The $20 registration fee will license one copy for use on
any one computer at any one time.  You must treat this software just like
a book.  An example is that this software may be used by any number of
people and may be freely moved from one computer location to another, so
long as there is no possibility of it being used at one location while
it's being used at another. Just as a book cannot be read by two different
persons at the same time.

Commercial users of SkyGlobe 3.5 must register and pay for their copies of
SkyGlobe 3.5 within 30 days of first use or their license is withdrawn.
Site-License arrangements may be made by contacting Klassm Software.

Anyone distributing SkyGlobe 3.5 for any kind of remuneration must first
contact KlassM SoftWare at the address below for authorization. This
authorization will be automatically granted to distributors recognized
by the (ASP) as adhering to its guidelines for shareware distributors,
and such distributors may begin offering SkyGlobe 3.5 immediately (However
KlassM SoftWare must still be advised so that the distributor can be kept
up-to-date with the latest version of SkyGlobe 3.5.).

You are encouraged to pass a copy of SkyGlobe 3.5 along to your friends
for evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their copy if they find
that they can use it.  All registered users will receive a copy of the
latest version of the SkyGlobe 3.5 system.


                            Ombudsman Statement

"This program is produced by a member of the Association of Shareware
 Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware
 principle works for you. If you are unable to resolve a
 shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting the member
 directly, ASP may be able to help. The ASP Ombudsman can help you
 resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but does not provide
 technical support for members' products.  Please write to the ASP
 Ombudsman at 545 Grover Road, Muskegon, MI 49442 or send a CompuServe
 message via CompuServe Mail to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536."
