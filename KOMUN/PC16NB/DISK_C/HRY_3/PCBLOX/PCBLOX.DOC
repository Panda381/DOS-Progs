	                  Part 1 - Introduction


	WHAT IS PC-BLOX?

	PC-BLOX is a new concept in 3-D CAD (Computer Assisted Design)
	programs.  PC-BLOX lets you build three dimensional models out
	of solid building blocks.  Build cars, trucks, animals,
	castles, spaceships or anything else you can imagine, the
	possibilities are unlimited!

	PC-BLOX is a virtual reality program that simulates building
	with solid blocks.  PC-BLOX is easier to learn and use than
	any other 3-D CAD program because it uses skills you already
	have:  building with blocks.  Your creations develop in
	PC-BLOX as you intuitively add and remove shapes in space.

	Other 3-D CAD programs can be very difficult to use.  First
	you must use the program to build a "wire frame" version of
	your model.  Then the program must "render" your wire frame
	model into a solid model by removing hidden lines and covering
	the frame with "patches".  PC-BLOX offers an alternative to
	the wire frame and surface patch metaphor.

	PC-BLOX is an entertaining and educational product that
	stimulates creativity, coordination and spatial thinking
	skills.  It is appropriate for users age 8 to adult.
	Everybody finds PC-BLOX easy building fun!

	PC-BLOX is distributed through shareware, a try-before-you-buy
	method of software marketing.  If you enjoy PC-BLOX you'll
	want to buy a registered copy.  As a registered user you will
	get:

	* The very latest version of PC-BLOX.

	* Your own Personalized copy of PC-BLOX that proudly displays
	  your name on the opening screen and the Main Menu.

	* The FULLY ILLUSTRATED PC-BLOX Registered User's Guide.

	* The PC-BLOX Model Gallery - A disk full of great models
	  including the latest PC-BLOX Design Contest winners.

	* Unlimited telephone support.

	* Access to the (soon to be available) PC-BLOX BBS.

	* Low cost Upgrades to future versions of PC-BLOX.




	All this for just $27 plus $3 shipping and handling.

	HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

	PC-BLOX requires an IBM PC/XT/AT or close compatible running
	MS DOS 2.0 or higher, 512K of memory and a color graphics
	display adapter (CGA, EGA or VGA) and any monitor.

	Optional - PC-BLOX will use a Microsoft compatible mouse (most
	are) and a printer that supports the IBM-Epson standard (most
	do).


	HOW TO INSTALL PC-BLOX

	You can install PC-BLOX directly to your hard disk.

	1. Start your computer and get to the C> prompt.
	2. Place the PC-BLOX diskette in the A: drive.
	3. Log onto the A: drive.
	4. Type INSTALL and press Enter.
	5. Follow the instructions in the INSTALL program.

	The INSTALL program will create a new directory on the hard
	disk called C:\PC-BLOX and will copy all of the PC-BLOX files
	to this new directory.

	If you prefer to install PC-BLOX to a diskette instead, or if
	you prefer to install to a different directory, you may do so
	by copying all the files with the standard DOS copy commands.


	THE PC-BLOX FILES

	The following files come on the PC-BLOX shareware evaluation
	disk.

	   PC-BLOX.EXE   The PC-BLOX program.
	   PC-BLOX.DT1   Graphics data file.
	   PC-BLOX.DT2   Graphics data file.
	   PC-BLOX.HLP   Help Screen data file.
	   CONTEST.DOC   Contest Entry Blank.
	   PC-BLOX.DOC   This User's Guide.
	         *.BLX   Sample model files.
	   INSTALL.BAT   Installation program.
	       ASK.COM   A utility used by the Installation program.
	      DEMO.BAT   A batch file that demonstrates PC-BLOX.
	    VENDOR.DOC   Distribution information.
	   FILE_ID.DIZ   A description file for BBS's.
	    README.DOC   Introductory material.

	HOW TO START PC-BLOX

	If you used the INSTALL program as described above, then this
	is how to start PC-BLOX:

	1. Start your computer and get to the C> prompt.
	2. Type CD \PC-BLOX and press Enter.
	3. Type PC-BLOX and press Enter.

	If you DID NOT use the INSTALL program, but instead did your
	own custom installation, then you need to know that the actual
	program file is PC-BLOX.EXE .

	A title page and a shareware registration screen will appear
	while the program loads.


	USING COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

	You can set some features of PC-BLOX by using command line
	options at start-up.  The command line options include a way
	to configure the mouse, select a printer type, and load a
	model file.  Tpye command line options after typing PC-BLOX
	and before pressing Enter.  Case is not important.  You can
	separate the options with spaces but it is not necessary.

	M=number: Controls mouse sensitivity.  The default is 10.  If
	the mouse moves the cursor too fast for you, increase this
	number.  For a more "lively" mouse, reduce this number.  If
	you experience a problem with the mouse and you want to
	completely disable it, set this to zero.

	P=printer: Selects printer type, either IBM, Epson or None (no
	printer).  The default is IBM.  You can also select this from
	the Print menu.

	F=filename.BLX: Tells PC-BLOX to load a model file on
	start-up.  The file must be present in the same directory as
	PC-BLOX (paths are not allowed).  The .BLX extension must be
	present.


	Some Examples:

	PC-BLOX M=30 F=FOO.BLX        start up with mouse sensitivity
	                              set to 30 and load FOO.BLX.

	PC-BLOX P=EPSON               start up with printer set to
	                              Epson.

	PC-BLOX M=0 P=NONE F=FOO.BLX  start up with mouse disabled,
	                              no printer, and load FOO.BLX.
	PC-BLOX User's Guide                                         4



	To save these start up options you can create a batch file
	that includes them.  You can make a batch file with any text
	editor program or you can do it this way:

	At the DOS prompt type:

	COPY CON MYBLOX.BAT

	and press Enter.  The cursor will simple drop down a line.
	Then type:

	PC-BLOX M=30 P=NONE

	or whatever options you want.  Then press the F6 key followed
	by the Enter key.  When you press F6 you will see a ^Z appear,
	and when you press Enter you should see a message saying
	"1 File(s) copied." Now any time you type MYBLOX (Enter) at
	the DOS prompt, PC-BLOX will start up with your options.


	HOW TO USE THIS USER'S GUIDE

	It's not necessary to read this entire manual before using
	PC-BLOX.

	Work through the Quick Start Instructions in the next section.
	This will teach you what you need to know to get started
	building models.

	Next, skim through "Part 2 - The PC-BLOX Screen".  You will
	probably have already figured out most of this from working
	through the Quick Start.

	When you have specific questions about how to proceed, refer
	to "Part 3 - How To Use PC-BLOX".  This is written in a "how
	to", results oriented format.

	When you become comfortable with the basic commands, learn the
	powerful Range commands in "Part 4 - The Range Functions".

	Appendix page A1 is a "Quick Guide" to the commands.  You may
	want to keep this beside you as you learn.


	QUICK START INSTRUCTIONS

	To give PC-BLOX a test drive before reading through this
	User's Guide, here are some things to try.

	First, press F3 to erase the screen and remove all the blocks
	from the building area.
	                                            |/
	Notice the cursor that looks like this:   --*--
	                                           /|
	PC-BLOX User's Guide                                         5



	This is the "3D-cursor".  Try moving the cursor around.  You
	can move the cursor left, right, up and down with the arrow
	keys.  You can move it IN and OUT with the Page-Up and
	Page-Down keys.

	Press Enter.  A block appears where the cursor is.  Move the
	cursor around and add some more blocks.  Try building some
	columns and arches out of blocks.  See what happens when you
	put blocks behind, above, below or beside other blocks.
	You're building a "model".

	Press F6 and select Rotate Left.  See how the entire model
	turns by a quarter turn.  If you do this 3 more times all the
	blocks will be back where they started.

	So far you have been using only the solid cube block.  It's
	time to add some other shapes to your model.

	  - Press F2 to get the Blocks Menu.

	  - Move the cursor to the right until it rests on the wedge
	    block.  The wedge is the third block from the right on the
	    top row of blocks.

	  - Press Enter.  Notice how the bottom row of blocks now
	    shows all wedges in different positions.

	  - Move the cursor to one of the wedges in the bottom row and
	    press Enter.

	You have just selected a new type of block to build with.
	Notice the box in the lower right corner of the screen.  The
	block in it has changed from a cube to the wedge.  This is the
	"Current Block" and it always shows what kind of block you are
	building with.

	Add some wedges to your model.  Pick some different blocks
	from the Blocks Menu (F2) and add them to your model.

	Remove some blocks from your model.  Place the cursor on the
	block and press the DEL key or Shift F3 (hold down the shift
	key and press F3).  After removing a few blocks, press F4 to
	see PC-BLOX rebuild your model.

	Go to the Files Menu (F9) and load some of the example models
	included  with PC-BLOX.  These will give you some good ideas
	for your own models.

	That's it for our quick tour of PC-BLOX.  The rest of the
	User's Guide explains things in more detail.

	THE BUILDING SPACE

	The building space fills the center of the screen.  It
	occupies a volume 18 units wide, 18 units deep and 11 units
	high.  The total volume of the building space (18 times 18
	times 11) equals 3564 unit cubes.  Each unit cube can hold one
	building block.  The 3 dimensions of the building space are
	called X, Y and Z, where:

	  X goes left-right,
	  Y goes up-down, and
	  Z goes forward-back (toward or away from the viewer).

	THE 3D-CURSOR

	The 3D-cursor is the star-shaped object that starts in the
	lower left front corner of the building space.  You can move
	the 3D-cursor around the building space with the arrow keys
	and the page-up and page-down keys.  You use the 3D-cursor to
	point to where you want to add blocks to your model.


	THE CURSOR COORDINATES

	The cursor coordinates show the position of the 3D-cursor as
	numbers.  The lower left front corner location of the Building
	space has the coordinates X=0 Y=0 Z=0.  This location is
	called the "home" position.  The X coordinate increases toward
	the right, Y increases toward the top and Z increases toward
	the rear.  The corner opposite to the home position has the
	coordinates X=17 Y=10 Z=17.  The cursor coordinates help you
	to position the 3D-cursor.

	THE CURSOR GUIDES

	The cursor guides are the 3 small framed "windows" in the
	upper left corner of the screen.  Each window is a small
	picture of the building space.

	The corner window shows the building space straight-on from
	the front.

	The right window shows the building space straight-on from the
	right hand side.

	The lower window shows the building space straight down from
	the top.

	The purpose of the cursor guides is to help you see exactly
	where the 3D-cursor is.  As you move the 3D-cursor around the
	building space you will also see it move inside the cursor
	guides.

	THE CURSOR BLOCK

	The cursor block shows what type of block the 3D-cursor is on.
	If the 3D-cursor is on an empty space, the cursor block shows
	a shadow.  As you move the 3D-cursor through different types
	of blocks the cursor block is updated.  Just like the cursor
	guides explained above, the cursor block is there to help you
	position the 3D-cursor.


	THE BOTTOM SURFACE

	The bottom surface is the flat "checker board" on the bottom
	of the building space.  This provides a flat table to build
	your models on.


	THE CURRENT BLOCK

	The current block is the type of block you "have in your
	hand" and are adding to your model.  When PC-BLOX first starts
	up, the current block is the solid cube block.  When you want
	to add a different type of block to your model, you must
	change the current block.  There are two ways to pick a new
	current block: You can press F2 and use the Blocks Menu, or
	you can use a block you already have in your model.  The
	section "How to Add Other Kinds of Blocks" explains how to do
	this.


	THE MODEL

	The model is PC-BLOX's name for the object you are building.
	More than just a flat picture, the model is an image of a 3
	dimensional figure that you can turn, move and operate on in
	many ways.


	SHADOWS

	Shadows appear on the bottom surface.  A block casts a shadow
	straight down as if the light source was directly above the
	building space.  The 3D-cursor also casts a shadow.  Shadows
	improve the sense of depth in the picture and make the model
	look more realistic.  Shadows also help you position the
	3D-cursor.


	THE RANGE DIMENSIONS

	The range dimensions are displayed when you are marking a
	range with the Mark Range command (F7).  Certain range
	functions only work on the proper size range.

	               PART 3 - HOW TO USE PC-BLOX


	HOW TO GET HELP

	Call up context-sensitive help at any time in PC-BLOX by
	pressing F1.  There are 26 help pages labeled A-Z.  Page A is
	the index.  Inside of Help, press letter keys A-Z to go
	directly to a page or use Page Up and Page Down to scroll
	through the pages.  Press Escape to return to PC-BLOX.

	If you have problems that you cannot resolve with the on-line
	help and this User's Guide, I will be happy to assist you over
	the telephone.  My technical support line is (919) 291-8716.
	If you have not yet registered, I can provide limited help to
	get you up and running, however, in-depth phone support is
	reserved for registered users.


	HOW TO MOVE THE 3D-CURSOR

	The 3D-cursor is your "hand" in PC-BLOX.  You can move it
	anywhere in the building space with the arrow keys and the
	Page Up and Page Down keys.  You can also move the 3D-cursor
	with the mouse - See the section, "How to Use the Mouse".

	HOW TO ADD BLOCKS

	To add a block to your model, just move the 3D-cursor to where
	you want the block and press Enter.  You have an endless
	supply of blocks.  If you place a block in a spot that already
	has one, the old block disappears.


	HOW TO REMOVE A BLOCK

	Place the 3D-cursor on the block you want to remove and press
	the Delete or DEL key, or press SHIFT F3 (hold down the SHIFT
	key and press F3).

	Sometimes removing a block will cause a "hole" in the image
	that lets the background color show through.  You can fix this
	with the "Rebuild Model" command, F4.

	To remove ALL the blocks from the building space, press F3.
	PC-BLOX User's Guide                                        11



	If you want to remove all the blocks from ONE PART of the
	building space, you can mark that part as a RANGE and delete
	the blocks in it.  Read about ranges in Part 4 - The Range 
	Functions.


	HOW TO ADD OTHER KINDS OF BLOCKS

	To add a different shape block to your model, you must change
	the current block.  Remember, the current block is the kind of
	block you "have in your hand" and are adding to the model.
	There are two ways to pick a new current block.

	Most of the time you will use the Blocks Menu (F2) to select a
	new current block.  The Blocks Menu has many different
	features and options - See the section "Using the Blocks Menu"
	for more information.

	If the type of block you want is already in the model, you can
	tell PC-BLOX to make it the new current block.  Place the
	3D-cursor on the block and press SHIFT F2 (hold down the Shift
	key and press F2).  Remember, this is a shortcut for selecting
	a new current block.  If the block you want is not already in
	the model, you must use the Blocks Menu (F2).


	HOW TO CHANGE THE COLORS OF A BLOCK

	You can re-arrange the colors of any block in the building
	space.  Place the 3D-cursor on the block and press SHIFT F5
	(hold down the Shift key and press F5).  You may need to do
	this several times to get the color combination you want.

	You can also re-arrange the colors of the current block by
	pressing ALT F5 (hold down the ALT key and press F5).

	To change the screen colors, use the Color Menu, F5.  The
	Color Menu is described in the section, "Using the Color
	Menu".


	HOW TO TURN A BLOCK

	Place the 3D-cursor on the block and press SHIFT F6 (hold down
	the Shift key and press F6).  You may need to do this several
	times to get the block pointed the way you want.

	Sometimes turning a block will cause a "hole" in the image
	that lets the background color show through.  You can fix this
	with the "Rebuild Model" command, F4.

	You can turn the current block, too.  Press ALT F6 to do this.
	(Hold down the ALT key and press F6).

	If you want to turn the entire model, use the Rotation Menu,
	F6.  See the section "Using the Rotation Menu".
	PC-BLOX User's Guide                                        12



	HOW TO CLEAR THE SCREEN

	Press F3 to completely erase your model and start over with
	the building space empty.


	HOW TO REBUILD YOUR MODEL

	Press F4 to rebuild your model.  PC-BLOX will rebuild the
	entire model block by block, right before your very eyes!.
	It's good to do this ocasionally as you build your models.
	Certain operations, such as removing or turning a block, may
	cause "holes" in the picture or distort the perspective.
	Rebuild Model will repair these problems.


	HOW TO EXIT PC-BLOX

	Press F10 to exit PC-BLOX.  Be sure to save your work before
	quitting.  See the section "Using the Files Menu" for more
	information about saving your work.


	HOW TO USE THE MENUS

	Menus and commands can be called up by their Function Keys or
	can be selected from the Main Menu.  The Main Menu is called
	up by the Escape key.  Press Escape to exit any menu.  Notice
	how the Escape key "toggles" the Main Menu on and off.

	Once inside a menu, use the arrow keys to highlight the
	desired menu option and press Enter.


	"GHOSTED" MENU OPTIONS

	Sometimes a menu option will have a garbled or "ghosted out"
	appearance.  This means the menu option is not available (at
	that moment) and cannot be selected.


	SAFETY NETS

	You must confirm certain choices with Y or y for "Yes"; or
	with N or n for "No, cancel".  This happens in three
	circumstances:

	a) When you Quit to DOS (F10)
	b) When you Erase Model (F3)
	c) When you overwrite a file in the File Menu (F9)

	HOW TO USE A MOUSE WITH PC-BLOX

	If you wish to use a mouse with PC-BLOX, then the mouse driver
	program must be started before the PC-BLOX program is ran.
	Consult your mouse user's guide for instructions on loading
	the mouse driver.

	You can use a mouse to move the 3D-cursor, select menu
	options, and do just about anything else in PC-BLOX.
	PC-BLOX can use either a two button or a three button mouse.
	The mouse can substitute for for the most important keys.  To
	adjust the sensitivity of the mouse see the section "Using
	Command Line Options."

	USING THE BLOCKS MENU

	PC-BLOX has dozens of different type blocks.  Use the Blocks
	Menu to pick the kind of block you want to work with.  Press
	F2 to get the Blocks Menu.  This is what the menu looks like:

	   |                 +-- the bottom row of blocks
	   |
	   +-- the Color Swapping symbol


	The top row of blocks shows all the different CLASSES of
	blocks available.  There are forty (40) classes.  Only ten
	classes can be shown at one time.  Use the cursor to select
	the word MORE and you will see ten more classes.

	The classes that contain only a single cube block are
	placeholders that will be filled up with new types of blocks
	in future versions of PC-BLOX.

	Once you pick a class from the top row, the bottom row will
	show all of the blocks in that class.  Usually, the bottom row
	displays all the different positions a block can be placed in.
	For example, if you select the Wedge shape from the top row,
	the bottom row will show the twelve (12) ways the wedge can be
	positioned.

	The Color Swapping symbol lets you re-arrange the colors of
	the blocks on the bottom row.  You may need to select this
	more than once to get the color combination you want.

	The Blocks Menu cursor has a 3-D cube shape so you can see how
	each block fits in the unit cubes of the building space.

	When you pick a block from the bottom row it becomes the new
	curent block.

	If you decide you don't really want to change the current
	block, just press Escape to exit the Blocks Menu.  You can
	also select the word MENU to jump to the Main Menu.
	PC-BLOX User's Guide                                        15



	USING THE COLOR MENU

	You can change the screen colors with the Color Menu, F5.  If
	your system has only CGA graphics, you can select between two
	foreground palettes and sixteen background colors.  If your
	system has EGA or VGA graphics, you can assign any of the
	sixteen colors to the background and the three foreground
	colors.


	USING THE ROTATION MENU

	You can see the real 3D power of PC-BLOX with the features on
	the Rotation Menu, F6.  You can turn the building space left,
	right or completely around; or flip it into a mirror image or
	even upside-down.  To see how the Rotation Menu works, load
	one of the sample models and try it out.


	USING THE PRINT MENU

	You can print your models on most dot-matrix printers with the
	Print Menu, F8.  Three of the options on the Print Menu are
	"toggles" you can change with the Enter key.  After setting
	these options to your preferences, select *BEGIN PRINTING*.

	PRINTER = option: Set this to IBM if your printer is (or is
	set up to work like) the IBM Graphics Printer, Proprinter or
	Proprinter II.

	Set this to Epson if your printer is (or is set up to work
	like) an Epson LX, FX or EX.  If you are not sure about which
	printer option to use, just try one, then the other.

	Set this to NONE to see the final product without printing, or
	to capture with a screen capture utility for some other
	graphics program, or to print the picture with the DOS
	GRAPHICS.COM program.  Note: you still must select *BEGIN
	PRINTING* to remove the menu.

	Once you know which printer type to use, you can tell PC-BLOX
	to start up with that printer selected.  See the section
	"Using Command Line Options."

	BOTTOM = option: Set this to ABSENT if you want the bottom
	surface and shadows to disappear.  Set it to PRESENT to keep
	them in the picture.

	ORIENT = option: Set this to LANDSCAPE for a full page
	printout, PORTRAIT for a half page printout.

	COLOR = option: Set this to NORMAL for black and gray printing
	on a white background.  Set this to INVERTED for white and
	gray printing on a black background.

	USING THE FILES MENU

	You can save your creations and load them back in at any time
	with the Files Menu, F9.

	SAVE MODEL will prompt you to enter a file name.  Enter a name
	up to 8 characters long.  (Normal editing commands like
	backspace and delete will work when you are entering file and
	directory names.) The default file name is the name of the
	last model loaded.  If the file name already exists on the
	disk, PC-BLOX will ask you if you really want to replace it.
	PC-BLOX appends the extension ".BLX" to your file name.

	LOAD MODEL gives you a pick screen of file names.  Use the
	arrow keys or mouse to highlight your choice and then press
	Enter.  You can also tell PC-BLOX to load a file upon start up
	by giving the file name as a command line option.  See the
	section "Using Command Line Options".

	CHANGE PATH lets you change the drive and directory model
	files are saved to and loaded from.  Put in any legal path
	name.  PC-BLOX defaults to the path it was started from.

	              PART 4 - THE RANGE FUNCTIONS

	The Range features extend the 3D power of PC-BLOX even
	further.  With the Range functions you can manipulate multi-
	block "pieces" of your models.

	WHAT IS A RANGE?

	A range is box-shaped (rectangular solid) part of the building
	space.  A range can have any size from a single unit cube (1 x
	1 x 1) to the entire building space (18 x 11 x 18).  Usually a
	range is between these two size extremes.  You select a range
	by "marking" it with the Range Cursor.

	HOW TO MARK A RANGE

	1.  Select Mark a Range from the Main Menu, or press F7.  The
	3D-Cursor will be replaced with the Range Cursor.  The Range
	Cursor looks like a transparent cube.

	2.  Next you must tell PC-BLOX where the range starts.  Move
	the Range Cursor to a corner - any corner - of the range you
	want to mark.  (Move the Range Cursor with the same commands
	you use to move the 3D-cursor.)

	3.  When the Range Cursor is on the corner, press Enter.  This
	"sets" one corner of the range.

	4.  Now as you use the movement commands, the Range Cursor
	will grow and shrink, actually getting bigger and smaller but
	always keeping one corner on the spot you picked in step 3.
	You can even see the Range Cursor changing size inside of the
	cursor guides.  You can also see the Range Dimensions in the
	bottom right corner of the screen.

	5.  When the Range Cursor exactly covers the range you want,
	press Enter.  Now you have finished marking the range, and the
	Range Menu appears.

	NOTE: Press ESC to "back your way out" one step at a time in
	the above instructions.

	RANGE MENU OPTIONS

	COPY RANGE lets you put a copy of the range somewhere else in
	the building space.  Move the range with the regular movement
	commands.  Press Enter to place a copy in the new position.
	You can cancel this command with ESC.

	MOVE RANGE works just like COPY RANGE but also removes the
	blocks in the original range.

	ERASE RANGE simply removes all blocks from the marked range.

	BLOCK FILL fills the marked range with the current block.
	Make sure you select the type of block you want to fill with
	BEFORE marking the range.

	ROTATE RANGE "turns" the whole range in place.  Whether or not
	you can turn the range in a certain direction depends on the
	size of the marked range.  The range can only be rotated if 2
	or 3 of its dimensions are the same size.  See Figure 7 for a
	picture explanation of this concept.

	FLIP RANGE flips the range into a mirror image of itself.  The
	range can be reflected from left to right, from top to bottom
	or from front to back.

	EXTRUDE RANGE lets you "pull" a flat surface out in a third
	dimension.  A range is "flat" if it is only one block thick.
	In other words, the X, Y or Z dimension must equal one.

	Extrude is good for building large pieces out of one-block
	thick cross sections.  Extrude works by taking the one-block
	thick "slice" you have marked and stacking copies of it
	together to make a larger object.

	See Figure 8 for a picture explanation of EXTRUDE RANGE.

	After you select the direction to extrude in, use the movement
	commands to "grow" and "shrink" the range cursor.  Press Enter
	to extrude the original range into the new range.  You can
	press ESC at any time to cancel EXTRUDE RANGE.

	USING THE LAST MARKED RANGE

	Sometimes you will want to use the same range twice.  There
	are two good reasons to do this:

	1.  To make more than one copy of the range; and 2. To make
	symmetrical objects.

	To use the last range, press SHIFT F7 (hold down the shift key
	and press F7) or select USE LAST RANGE from the Main Menu.


	MAKING MULTIPLE COPIES

	To make 2 or more copies of an object, follow this procedure:

	1.  Make the first copy by using RANGE and COPY in the usual
	way.

	2.  Now select USE LAST RANGE from the Main Menu or with Shift
	F7.  The Range Cursor will become positioned around the new
	copy and the Range Menu will pop up.

	3.  Select COPY RANGE from the Range Menu.  Now use the
	movement commands to move the range to where you want another
	copy and press Enter.

	4.  If even more copies are desired, keep using USE LAST RANGE
	and COPY.


	MAKING SYMMETRICAL OBJECTS

	Many real-world objects you may wish to model with PC-BLOX
	have left-right symmetry.  For example, the left half of an
	automobile resembles a mirror image of the right half.  You
	may find this procedure helpful when making symmetrical
	objects:

	1.  Build one side of the object, up to the mid-line.  Leave
	 enough room for the other half.

	2.  Use COPY to put a duplicate right next to and touching the
	original half.

	3.  Re-mark the new piece with USE LAST RANGE (SHIFT F7) .
	Use FLIP RANGE to flip the new piece into the right shape.

	               PART 5 - THE BUILDING BLOCKS

	The building blocks in PC-BLOX come in about 300 different
	sizes, shapes, and positions.  There are three categories of
	blocks: BASIC, ARCHITECTURAL and ALPHA blocks.  The three
	kinds can be mixed freely in any model, but there are
	important difference between them.

	BASIC blocks are the simple geometric shapes; the cubes, half
	cubes, spheres, hemispheres, wedges etc.  The basic blocks are
	general purpose and can be used to represent anything you
	like.  The basic blocks can be correctly rotated in any
	direction.

	ARCHITECTURAL blocks are those special pieces like roofs,
	flags, bricks etc.  Architectural pieces are meant to
	represent specific real life objects.  PC-BLOX can only render
	these objects in their usual, everyday positions.  Because of
	this, there are certain limitations on the way these pieces
	can be acted on in the Range Menu and the Rotation Menu.
	These pieces can only be correctly rotated LEFT, RIGHT and 180
	Degrees.  They can be flipped FRONT to BACK and LEFT to RIGHT
	but they cannot be correctly flipped TOP to BOTTOM.  If these
	pieces are rotated or flipped improperly, they will move into
	the correct position in the building space but will still be
	pointed in their original direction.

	ALPHA blocks are solid-cube blocks "stamped" with a letter,
	number or some other symbol.  You can make signs and messages
	with alpha blocks.  To make alpha blocks, select the solid
	cube block as the current block and press character keys
	instead of Enter.  Every type-able character on the keyboard
	can be produced this way.

	Press Control A-Z to get special characters like hearts, stars
	etc.  Look at the Alpha Blocks Help screen to see these
	special characters; unfortunately they cannot be reproduced in
	this text-only User's Guide.

	Notice that when you use an alpha block the 3D-Cursor MOVES TO
	THE RIGHT just like an ordinary text cursor in a word
	processor.

	TIPS FOR BUILDING BETTER MODELS

	Although it's lots of fun to build PC-BLOX models right from
	your imagination, you may also enjoy working from a picture or
	from a real object.  Try catalogs, magazines, model cars and
	other toys.  A certain manufacturer of plastic blocks
	publishes "idea" books for its products.  These are very
	good for examples, and so are the instruction sheets that come
	with plastic blocks.

	When you start a model, don't worry about getting the details
	just right.  Instead, think about the overall proportions of
	the object first.  Make a rough model out of boxes of solid
	cubes.  Use the Range BLOCK FILL function to make these boxes.
	Once you have the model "boxed out" this way, go back and add
	the curves, angles and other details you want.

	Use the Range functions to duplicate similar pieces.  If you
	were building, say, a dinosaur, once you have the built the
	right leg, use Copy and Flip to make the left leg, etc.

	Send your best models in to the PC-BLOX Design Contest!
