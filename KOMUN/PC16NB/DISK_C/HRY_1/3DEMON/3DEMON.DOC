                      A Chase And Be Chased Game in 3D

                                     by
                     John D. Price and Rick Richardson




                            1.  GETTING STARTED

         3-Demon  requires  an  IBM Personal Computer with at least
         128 kilobytes of memory, one single-sided  disk  drive,  a
         color  graphics adapter, and a black and white, or a color
         monitor.

         To start 3-Demon, simply type 3-Demon at the  DOS  command
         prompt.  After  a few seconds, you will be asked what type
         of display you have. Press the "b" key if you have a black
         and white display, or press the "c"  key  if  you  have  a
         color  display.  You will then be in the 3-Demon "attract"
         mode until you select a game level.

         To return from 3-Demon to PC-DOS, first finish playing any
         game in progress (or end the game by  pressing  the  "Esc"
         key). Then press the "Esc" key to return to PC-DOS.


                               2.  GAME PLAY

         The  object  of  3-Demon is to descend through the various
         mazes without being eaten by the ghouls.  The  measure  of
         your success is the number of points you accumulate before
         all of your lives are devoured.

         In  3-Demon  you  are not simply a voyeur, watching from a
         safe perch above the action. You are the  main  character,
         running through the hallways and fleeing from the ghouls.

         The ghouls in 3-Demon chase you through the various mazes.
         You must attempt to avoid them in your search for the food
         dots.  The power pills allow you to turn the tables on the
         ghouls, chasing and eating them. Be  careful.  Your  power
         does  not  last  forever.  When you have eaten most of the
         food in a maze, you will fall down to the next lower maze.

         The radar display aids you  in  avoiding  the  ghouls.  It
         allows  you  to  see  around  corners, giving you a slight
         advantage over the ghouls who do not possess such advanced
         technology.















                           3.  USING THE KEYBOARD

         Your movements are controlled using  the  keyboard.  These
         are the meanings of the keys that are used:

         Up Cursor     Move forward, down the hall. You cannot walk
                       through  walls.  If  you hold this key down,
                       you will move forward as far and as fast  as
                       you can, until you hit a wall.

         ->            Turn  to  the right. To turn down a hallway,
                       you must be next to the doorway.  Otherwise,
                       you will turn and face a wall.

         <-            Turn to the left.

         5             Turn  around,  facing  where  you came from.
                       Good to check for trailing  ghouls,  and  to
                       change direction in a hurry.

         Down Cursor   Go down to the next maze. This only works if
                       you  have  eaten half the food in that maze.
                       Good for quick escapes.

         Esc           Give up and exit that game. Wimp.

         Num Lock      Quiet. Good for late  night  or  you-really-
                       should-be-working   games.  Press  Num  Lock
                       again and the hallways become  noisy  places
                       to wander.

         Scroll Lock   Pause. Take a break. Press Scroll Lock again
                       to resume play.

         H             Help! What key do I hit to get that break?

         Large + key   Display the maze floor plan. Where am I? The
                       maze   plan  is  always  displayed  so  that
                       travelling forward would  move  you  towards
                       the top of the screen.



                               4.  THE SCREEN

         The 3-Demon display screen is divided into two major areas
         as depicted below:



















              +-------------------------------+---------------+
              |                               |     3-Demon   |
              |                               |    LEVEL LL   |
              |                               |    hh:mm:ss   |
              |                               | fd%   score   |
              |                               |       lives   |
              |       3D Display of Maze      |               |
              |           2D Maze Map         |  +---------+  |
              |                               |  |         |  |
              |                               | n|    o    |  |
              |                               |  |  radar  |  |
              |                               |  +---------+  |
              |                               |               |
              +-------------------------------+---------------+


         The  left  side  of  the  screen  usually displays a three
         dimensional (3D) view of the maze as it  appears  to  you,
         standing  in  a  hallway. When the large plus key has been
         pressed, this display switches to a  conventional  map  of
         the  maze and play is paused. There is a slight penalty in
         going to the 2D maze map, so use of this  mode  is  recom-
         mended  only  for  finding  those  last few food dots. The
         mazes are not very difficult, and you will soon learn them
         by playing 3-Demon.

         The right hand side of the screen contains several indica-
         tions of how well you are doing. "score" is  your  accumu-
         lated  score.  "LL"  is  your descent level in the 3-Demon
         mazes. "hh:mm:ss" is the  elapsed  time  since  you  began
         playing.  "fd" is the percent of food dots you have eaten.
         You do not have to eat all of the food dots to descend  to
         the  next  level.  When this number reaches 100%, you will
         automatically descend to the next level. "lives" indicates
         how many lives you have remaining. Each remaining life  is
         indicated by a smiling face on the display.

         Below  the  status indicators are two instrument displays.
         When you became trapped in the 3-Demon mazes, you  weren't
         left  empty  handed.  You  have  a  compass and a radar to
         detect nearby objects.

         The compass is a small  arrow  (marked  "n"  above)  which
         always  points towards true north. It is useful for making
         your way to a specific part of the maze.

         The on screen "radar" display is useful to avoid  becoming
         trapped  by  a  ghoul. Your position is always centered in
         the display and marked by  an  open  square  ("o"  in  the
         diagram  above). Ghouls appear on the display as filled in
         squares, and floating  stars  appear  as  'x'.  The  radar
         display  is  always  oriented  so  that travelling forward
         moves you toward the top of  the  radar  display  (top  of
         screen). The radar has a limited range and capability, and
         will  not show you the location of far away ghouls, walls,
         power pills, or food.










                             5.  LEVELS OF PLAY

         There are ten levels of play, 0-9. Level 0 is for learning
         only, with no monsters to distract  you.  Levels  1-9  are
         gradual  increases  in difficulty. As play levels increase
         you move faster, the mazes become more difficult  and  the
         ghouls  are  smarter  and quicker. Start out at a low play
         level.


                                6.  SCORING

         Since the final objective  of  the  game  is  to  get  the
         highest  score, an understanding of the scoring weights is
         important to develop a good strategy. Here are the scores:

                   Food Dots                         10
                   Power Pills                       50
                   First Ghoul                      200
                   Second Ghoul                     400
                   Third Ghoul                      800
                   Fourth Ghoul                    1600
                   Floating Star               At least 250
                   Finishing a Maze             80 * Depth


         In addition, as your  score  passes  5000  you  will  gain
         another  life. After that, you will receive extra lives at
         increasing intervals (greater that 5000 points).


                            7.  HIGH SCORE LISTS

         Your 3-Demon disk will store the ten  highest  scores  for
         each play level. If you are skilled enough to be among the
         top  ten  scorers  at that play level, you will be given a
         chance to enter you name in the list. Just  type  in  your
         name or nickname, and be immortalized.


                                8.  TACTICS

         Here are a few tips to help you get on the honor role:

          1. Finish off the maze instead of using the down key. You
             do not get points when using the down key.

          2. Turn often when being chased by ghouls. If they cannot
             see you down the hallway they soon forget you.

          3. Be  careful  when  you get to lower depths; the ghouls
             move faster.

          4. Learn to recognize the sounds. They can tip you off to
             important events.











          5. Use the radar screen. It allows you  to  "see"  around
             corners and avoid nearby ghouls.

          6. Play  at  level  0  for a while to get the feel of the
             three dimensional display. Use the maze  map  to  help
             you learn the floor plan of the maze.

          7. Once  you  get  proficient at using the keys, you will
             find that the fastest way to move around the  maze  is
             to  hold  the Up Arrow (forward) key down. To turn and
             keep moving, simply time your press of  the  right  or
             left  arrow  keys  so  that you press them at the same
             time as you reach  a  hallway.  You  do  not  need  to
             release the Up Arrow key to make a turn.
