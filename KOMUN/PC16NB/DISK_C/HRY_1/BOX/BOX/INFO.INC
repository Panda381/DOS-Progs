  Hello All. Just got this one called Low Blow by Electronic Arts. Seems
  pretty good and the protection was not all that hard, all I did was remove
  the doc check. Game play is fairly simple but here are the keys anyway:

     --Keyboard 1--                           --Keyboard 2--
       ==========                               ==========

Del = Jab                                       Move with QWE ASD ZXC
Ins = Cross                                     Left Shift = Cross
Ins + Del = Uppercut                            Space = Jab
Use number keys to move                         Shift + Space = Uppercut

   Well I hope this gets you started. Enjoy the game.....again thanks to
   Binary Brain for the originals. BTW, to use ADLIB type "BOX ADLIB".
   Use the same method for the other sound cards.
